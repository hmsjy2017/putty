<b>summary</b>: Vulnerability: crafted SFTP string may allow remote code execution<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>vulnerability:</i> This is a security vulnerability.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>high:</i> This should be fixed in the next release.<br>
<b>present-in</b>: 0.56 2005-02-20<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: 0.57 2005-02-21 <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=893d187b81991a7b259ede864b7d18ae60c59589">893d187b81991a7b259ede864b7d18ae60c59589</a><br>
<p>
Many versions of PSFTP and PSCP prior to 0.57 have a heap corruption
vulnerability in their treatment of string fields in the SSH File
Transfer Protocol (SFTP).

<p>
Since a string field is present in the server's response to the
<code>FXP_OPEN</code> request, this vulnerability can be triggered by
simply connecting to a malicious SFTP server.

<p>
(Note however that the vulnerability kicks in <em>after</em> host key
verification, so the host key of the server has to have been
accepted to get this far.)

<p>
SFTP is always used by PSFTP; it is also used by PSCP if available
(depending on server behaviour). It can be used in both SSH-2 and
SSH-1 (again, depending on server behaviour). Thus, a malicious server
can exploit this in all invocations of PSFTP and PSCP, unless the
<code>-scp</code> option is supplied to PSCP.

<p>
This bug was discovered by a contributor to
<a href="http://www.idefense.com/">iDEFENSE</a>'s
<a href="http://labs.idefense.com/vcp/">Vulnerability
Contributor Program</a>. Along with
<a href="vuln-sftp-readdir.html">vuln-sftp-readdir</a>, it is
documented in iDEFENSE's advisory
<a href="http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=201">02.21.05</a>,
mentioned in Secunia's advisory
<a href="http://secunia.com/advisories/14333/">SA14333</a>,
and has been assigned CVE ID <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-0467">CVE-2005-0467</a>.
It has also been individually assigned
<a href="http://www.osvdb.org/14003">OSVDB ID 14003</a>.

<p>
<em>Vulnerability details:</em>
If a string length that would read off the end of the SFTP packet was
supplied, <code>sftp.c:sftp_pkt_getstring()</code> would not return a
pointer to the string, but would return the server-supplied string
length. <code>fxp_open_recv()</code> would then call <code>mkstr()</code>
with that length; with a carefully crafted length field,
<code>mkstr()</code> would <code>malloc(0)</code> due to an integer
overflow, and then <code>memcpy()</code> data from <code>*NULL</code>
to that location, leading to a heap corruption. (The data copied to
the heap is not trivially server-controlled, but it can't be ruled out
on all platforms.)
