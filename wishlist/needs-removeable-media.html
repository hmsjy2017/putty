<p>
We've had several reports of trouble where PuTTY will not start (a
session, it sounds like, rather than at all) unless there is a disc in
a drive with removeable media: "There is no disk in the drive. Please
insert a disk into drive D:" (In all reports that have specified, it
has been D: rather than another drive, but of course that's the most
common removeable drive letter.) There's no obvious reason for this,
such as a path set in the configuration or shortcut that refers to the
removeable drive.

<p>
We've not run into this ourselves, or been able to reproduce it.

<p>
This is vaguely reminiscent of
<a href="pageant-dirhandle.html">pageant-dirhandle</a>, but probably
not the same thing.

<p>
The earliest version this has been reported with is 0.61. It appears
that it was the addition of support for 
<a href="win7-jumplists.html">Windows 7 jump lists.</a> that triggered
this. (All reports that have specified an OS have been with Windows 7.)

<p>
A correspondent says

<blockquote>
<p>
It appears to be hung / frozen at this function call.
<pre>Winjump.c/update_jumplist_from_registry/if (!SUCCEEDED(pCDL->lpVtbl->BeginList</pre>

<p>
The Windows documentation about ICustomDestinationList mentions calling the
SetAppID function beforehand, and I figured out that you need to call
SetCurrentProcessExplicitAppUserModelID before using SetAppID.

<p>
So, I added this to WinMain in window.c
<pre>       SetCurrentProcessExplicitAppUserModelID(L"PuTTY");</pre>

<p>
And tried again.  Voila!  No error.  I did not have to add a SetAppID before
BeginList.
</blockquote>

<p>
The call stack when it hangs seems to indicate that it's trying to
invent an App ID from things like filenames.

<p>
This seems like a harmless and useful change to make, so we've done so
(using a different string for UserModelID).
