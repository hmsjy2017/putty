<b>summary</b>: Vulnerability: Windows Pageant client code does not check response length field<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>vulnerability:</i> This is a security vulnerability.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>high:</i> This should be fixed in the next release.<br>

<b>fixed-in</b>: <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=b38d47e94cf6848dddeaa7aa50301456130715a9">b38d47e94cf6848dddeaa7aa50301456130715a9</a> (0.72)<br>
<p>
On Windows, when a PuTTY SSH client program sends a request to
Pageant, the code that receives the response from Pageant in a shared
memory buffer was not doing any range checking on the length field
stored at the start of that buffer.

<p>
So if a malicious program is playing the role of Pageant, or has taken
over an existing Pageant by some method, then it can deliberately send
an out-of-range response, to attempt to induce uncontrolled memory
reading or overlarge memory allocation by the client program.

<p>
This affects all the SSH client tools in the PuTTY suite: PuTTY
itself, Plink, PSCP and PSFTP.

<p>
We're not sure to what extent this bug is exploitable.

<p>
Also, even if it is exploitable, we think this bug is only even worth
exploiting under unusual circumstances. Normally, Pageant has all the
most valuable secrets in it, so if someone is in a position to take it
over then they probably don't need to attack PuTTY through it
afterwards. But it's just possible that malware that gets on to the
machine by other means might set itself up to mimic Pageant, if the
user isn't already running a real one, and then try to attack
instances of PuTTY when they do their routine check of Pageant. Also,
if PuTTY (but not Pageant) is running with elevated privilege, then a
malicious Pageant may be able to escalate its own privilege if it can
successfully attack the elevated PuTTY.

<p>
This vulnerability was found as part of a
<a href="https://hackerone.com/putty_h1c">bug bounty programme</a> run under
the auspices of the EU-FOSSA project.
