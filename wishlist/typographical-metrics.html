<b>summary</b>: Make PuTTY use the typographical metrics in TrueType fonts<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>low:</i> We aren&#x27;t sure whether to fix this or not.<br>
<p>
A user reported that the 'Inconsolata' font by Raph Levien works badly
in Windows PuTTY, because the Windows terminal front end sets the
terminal's character-cell height based on the obvious font metrics
provided by the Windows text rendering API (<code>usWinAscent</code>
and <code>usWinDescent</code>). Those metrics are based on the ink
extent of the font rather than on the typographically ideal line
spacing. And Inconsolata recently gained support for Vietnamese text,
with multiple diacritics which increase the font's ink extent, so the
lines are now more widely spaced than is desirable.

<p>
Apparently there's a separate set of metrics called the 'typographical
metrics', and a flag in the font header to request they be used.

<p>
Our correspondent forwarded on some useful implementation notes from
Raph Levien:

<blockquote>
<p>
The first step is to use <code>GetFontData</code> to read the relevant
tables. One is the OS/2 table, which has tag 0x322F534F, and the other
is head (tag 0x64616568). A good reference for bit-bashing these
tables btw is <code>sfntly</code>; here's the code for OS/2 and head.
Both are quite small, OS/2 is typically 96 bytes and head is 54 bytes,
so the buffers can be stack allocated. I recommend first calling with
out a buffer to get a size, then calling a second time with
<code>min(sizeof(stack buffer), </code><i>size
reported</i><code>)</code>. If the size reported from head is below 54
or the size of OS/2 is below 74, then bail (the sizes can vary
somewhat based on table version).

<p>
From the head table you'll need <code>unitsPerEm</code> (big-endian
<code>uint16</code> at offset 18), and from OS/2 you'll need
<code>fsSelection</code> (<code>uint16</code> at 62),
<code>sTypoAscender</code>, <code>sTypoDescender</code>, and
<code>sTypoLineGap</code> (<code>int16</code> at 68, 70, and 72). The
logic goes like this. If bit 7 is set (<code>fsSelection & 0x80 !=
0</code>), then compute ascent and descent from the typo metrics
instead. I'd recommend combining line gap and ascender, as this will
minimize clipping of accented characters. The math goes like this:

<pre>
round_up(units, font_height, unitsPerEm) = floor((units * font_height + units - 1) / unitsPerEm)

new_ascent = round_up(sTypoAscender + sTypoLineGap, font_height, unitsPerEm)
new_descent = round_up(-sTypoDescender, font_height, unitsPerEm)
</pre>

<p>
The sum of the two is your new height, to be used in place of
<code>tm.tmHeight</code>. You will also need to subtract
<code>tm.tmAscent - new_ascent</code> from your y coordinate when
drawing text (<code>ExtTextOut</code>) to avoid the baseline being too
low, as these drawing commands use the "top" as a reference point, and
the GDI understanding of that point is the point above the Vietnamese
accented characters, which is quite high.
</blockquote>

<p>
Some thoughts from our own side:
<ul>
<li>
We're not sure if we should switch to using these typographical
metrics all the time (if we can retrieve them successfully for a given
font), or keep using the old metrics in the absence of that flag in
the font. It's possible that using them unconditionally might be
better, on the basis that if they're provided then they're probably
useful, and we have no hard requirement to keep the window layout
backwards-compatible with older versions of PuTTY (unlike, say, an
application which would suddenly flow text differently across pages if
the font handling changed).

<li>
Also, it sounds to me as if deliberately adopting line spacing smaller
than the font's ink extents is going to mean that sometimes text falls
outside the character cell and doesn't get displayed. That's all right
for people who want to use Inconsolata (or another affected font)
<em>without</em> displaying Vietnamese text, and just want to avoid
being inconvenienced by the fact that the font also supports
Vietnamese. But it might be less useful if the Vietnamese text was the
whole point! So possibly this might also make it more important to
revise the font display so as to consistently <em>not</em> throw away
pieces of characters that fall outside their character cell.

<li>
If this is a good idea on Windows, it's surely a good idea on GTK too,
so we should investigate whether Pango is already doing it for us, and
if not, whether we can persuade it to.
</ul>

<p>
Existing worked example: <a href="https://git.libreoffice.org/core/+/34d7602954d4483b3bc9db700e7df2c15348947a%5E%21/">commit 34d7602954d4483b3bc9db700e7df2c15348947a in LibreOffice</a> seems to be doing something relevant to this.
