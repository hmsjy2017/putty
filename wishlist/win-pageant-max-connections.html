<b>summary</b>: After 30 or so simultaneous PuTTY sessions, Windows Pageant stops working<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>bug:</i> This is clearly an actual problem we want fixed.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>high:</i> This should be fixed in the next release.<br>
<b>present-in</b>: 0.75<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=6e69223dc262755c2cd2a3bba5c188d8fc91943a">6e69223dc262755c2cd2a3bba5c188d8fc91943a</a><br>
<p>
In version 0.75, Windows Pageant would stop working after a certain
number of PuTTYs (or other PuTTY tools) were active at the same time
(typically about 30). Subsequently started PuTTY tools would tend to
hang.

<p>
This was due to two separate bugs in the new Pageant connection
arrangements introduced in 0.75 (<a href="pageant-named-pipe.html">pageant-named-pipe</a>):
<ul>
<li>Whenever PuTTY made a named-pipe connection to Pageant, it would
not close the connection when it was done with. The led to connections
used for initial authentication staying needlessly open for the
lifetime of the PuTTY tool. This leak was fixed in
commit 6e69223dc2, which fixed the most obvious manifestations of
this problem.</li>
<li>That there was a limit at all on simultaneous connections to
Pageant was fixed later, in commit 17c57e1078. (The limit was about
60, but each PuTTY tool might make more than one.)</li>
</ul>
