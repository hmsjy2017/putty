<b>summary</b>: Line ending conversion (&quot;ASCII mode&quot;) in PSCP and PSFTP<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>medium:</i> This should be fixed one day.<br>
<p>
Possibly line-end conversion in PSCP and PSFTP. An option to turn it
on, an option (enabled by default) to turn it off, and perhaps an
option to try to auto-detect whether to turn it on or not. (Anyone
know a good heuristic for distinguishing text from binary files?
infozip has one, as does less; anyone want to comment on which is
better or whether there are better still?)

<p>
Heuristics shouldn't now be needed at the protocol end for SFTP, as
<code>SSH_FXF_TEXT</code> has now been proposed as of SFTP v4 (see
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-05.txt">draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-05</a>).
I don't know what implementations exist.

<p>
(However, note that this version of the protocol does not allow the
server to give hints to the client about whether the file is best
opened in text or binary mode, so the operation of "get" would have to
be manually switched by "text" and "binary" commands or similar.)

<p>
(The SCP protocol continues to have no notion of transferring a file
in anything other than binary mode.)

<p>
For "put", should we require explicit triggering of this mechanism for local
files via a command/option, or should we have a "guess" mode? If the
latter, I think we should be able to spot and cope with Unix-style
files on a Windows system.
