<p><pre>From a user:

Psftp doesn&#x27;t check return value for SSH2_FXP_CLOSE
request. The specifictaions of sftp protocol state:
&quot;The response to this request will be a SSH_FXP_STATUS
message.  One should note that on some server
platforms even a close can fail. This can happen e.g. 
if the server operating system caches writes, and an
error occurs while flushing cached writes during the
close.&quot;
http://www.openssh.org/txt/draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-02.txt

The server we use will identify failure when closing
the file. Currently psftp doesn&#x27;t give any indication
of the failure. 

Psftp should check the return value and if close is
not succesfull after writing to a file, 
user should be informed about failed file transfer
operation.

psftp -h
PuTTY Secure File Transfer (SFTP) client
Release 0.60

The problem happens at least on Windows, but I would
assume that it affects all platforms. 

Unfortunately the only server I know that has this
problem is not shared in public (only sold to certain
group of organizations), so mentioning it wouldn&#x27;t
help as you wouldn&#x27;t be able to test it anyway. But
the problem should be quite trivial to fix without
testing. 

The server in question doesn&#x27;t overwrite old file if
such exists with the same name, if closing fails. So
please don&#x27;t try to use stat() or similar to find out
if the transfer was successful, even if close fails.
If close fails, file is not transfered.
