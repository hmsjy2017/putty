<b>summary</b>: PuTTY should prefer host-key types it already has cached<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>high:</i> This should be fixed in the next release.<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: 2015-05-30 <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=d21041f7f8846b16ff6d72ed696d6190627e19b4">d21041f7f8846b16ff6d72ed696d6190627e19b4</a> (0.68)<br>
<p>
We've just added support for several new host key formats
(<a href="ecdsa.html">ECDSA</a>; <a href="ed25519.html">Ed25519</a>) for the first time in a long time.
EC host keys are already widely deployed in servers. If we do nothing,
this is going to lead to lots of users prompted for
<a href="https://tartarus.org/~simon/putty-snapshots/htmldoc/Chapter2.html#gs-hostkey">host key verification</a>
as if they were connecting to the server for the first time.

<p>PuTTY now deliberately adjusts its algorithm preferences to prefer
host key types that it already has in its cache.  This means that in
any case where pre-EC PuTTY would have successfully connected without
issuing a host-key prompt, post-EC PuTTY will do the same (using the
existing host key it knows rather than any new EC key; automatically
upgrading is a knotty problem covered by
<a href="host-key-rollover.html">host-key-rollover</a>).

<p>
<b>Update, March 2016:</b> in this situation, it's now possible to
upgrade to a newer host key manually, using the new "Cache new host
key type" submenu on the Special Commands menu.
