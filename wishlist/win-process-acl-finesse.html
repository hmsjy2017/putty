<b>summary</b>: Restrictive Windows process ACL causes trouble with screen readers, etc<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>semi-bug:</i> This might or might not be a bug, depending on your precise definition of what a bug is.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>high:</i> This should be fixed in the next release.<br>
<b>absent-in</b>: 0.66<br>
<b>present-in</b>: 0.67<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=e22120fea8d39e6a2ef6b2f4ab3ee5502f56169a">e22120fea8d39e6a2ef6b2f4ab3ee5502f56169a</a> 2017-01-30 (0.68)<br>
<p>
In PuTTY 0.67 on Windows, we restricted the process ACL with
SetSecurityInfo() in an attempt to defend against malicious other
processes (such as
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/seastorm/PuttyRider">PuttyRider</a>)
injecting code, reading sensitive data, etc. (In 0.67 this only applied
to PuTTY and PuTTYtel; in snapshots after 0.67, from 2016-04-03, we also
did this for PSFTP, PSCP, Plink, PuTTYgen, and Pageant.)

<p>
Perhaps unsurprisingly, this broke some interactions with other
software. Here are some things that stopped working with 0.67 which
are known or suspected to have been broken by this change:

<ul>
<li>Screen readers and similar software. In 0.67, unable to read
system menu or PuTTY settings category tree view contents.
<ul>
<li>Windows Narrator. In the snapshots, we've allowed
<tt>PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION</tt>, which is relatively harmless and
allows Narrator to work.</li>
<li><a href="http://nvaccess.org">NVDA</a>. To work fully, this
injects a DLL into PuTTY's memory space (IAccessible2Proxy.dll), so
there's probably nothing we can do to fix this that won't also allow
the likes of PuttyRider back in.</li>
</ul>
<li>Sharing PuTTY windows (read-only) with Microsoft Lync / Skype
for Windows. (Sharing the entire screen still works, apparently.)
Needs <tt>PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION | PROCESS_VM_READ</tt>,
apparently; we don't have the latter.</li>
<li>Trouble using Git with Plink as a transport
(e.g., <a href="https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/983">1</a>,
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38624606/error-waitpid-for-c-program-files-x86-putty-plink-exe-failed-no-child-proce">2</a>). Our rights setting
implicitly turns off anything we haven't considered, including the
ability to wait for our return status; apparently adding
<tt>SYNCHRONIZE</tt> back in fixes this. We have not yet done
this.</li>
<li>Tools like AquaSnap or ac'tivaid used for arranging windows can't
change the PuTTY window's size and position any more.</li>
<li>Software installed in corporate environments such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_loss_prevention_software">'data loss prevention' software</a>
(which watches clipboard operations and the like) has been reportedly
disrupted by this change. Since such software is functionally
indistinguishable from malware, this isn't surprising.</li>
<li>(Of course, debuggers can't attach, but if you're debugging you
could probably have recompiled PuTTY with the <tt>UNPROTECT</tt>
option.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
It might be possible to tone down our restrictive permissions to allow
harmless interactions with legitimate software. We've done this a little
bit since 0.67, although there's probably scope for more.

<p>
However, since it turns out that some screen-reading software (NVDA at
least) has behaviour indistinguishable from malware, that approach won't
be sufficient.

<p>
<b>Update, 2017-01:</b> we have turned off these ACL restrictions by
default, so out of the box, all the things that were broken by this
in 0.67 should be working again. A new command-line option
<tt>-restrict-acl</tt> lets you get something like the 0.67 behaviour
if you don't find it more trouble than it's worth.
