<b>summary</b>: Separate dedicated utility to act as connection sharing upstream<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>medium:</i> This should be fixed one day.<br>
<p>
The current PuTTY support for connection sharing works on the more or
less ad-hoc basis that the first PuTTY or Plink to connect to a host
becomes the 'upstream' (which manages the real SSH connection) and
accepts connections from other PuTTY tools which automatically become
'downstreams' (talking to the upstream rather than to the real
server).

<p>
A downside of this structure is that whichever PuTTY is first to
contact a given host has to remain active while it's managing any
connections from downstreams. This isn't a completely unfamiliar
phenomenon to power users of SSH – it's exactly analogous to
what happens when you end the terminal session in a PuTTY which still
has X11 or port forwardings active – but it would be nicer to
avoid it if possible, so that all visible PuTTYs behaved more or less
similarly.

<p>
To arrange this, we'd have to have the first PuTTY spawn a separate
process to act as a dedicated upstream. Then the PuTTY itself would
connect to that, once it was ready, and merely be its first downstream.

<p>
This is a tricky project, perhaps as much work again as implementing
connection sharing in the first place. Problems include:

<ul>
<li>
How would SSH authentication work, if it needed to be interactive? One
option would be to delegate the <code>ssh-userauth</code> protocol to
the primary downstream (and pass it a special protocol message
containing the cryptographic session ID for use in signatures).
<li>
Similarly, what about interactive elements of the transport protocol,
such as host key verification or warnings about insecure primitives?
<li>
How would the user access the dedicated upstream process, to adjust
its behaviour or emergency-terminate it? An obvious option is to have
it open a little GUI icon in the system tray, but what if there isn't
a system tray available (e.g. Unix PuTTY, run in a non-GUI context)?
There might need to be a control protocol by which downstreams could
talk to the dedicated upstream and tell it to change things.
<li>
What should the new utility be called? (Working title:
<code>pshare</code>.)
</ul>
