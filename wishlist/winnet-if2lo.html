<b>summary</b>: PuTTY refuses connections to 127.0.0.1 from interface IP addresses<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>semi-bug:</i> This might or might not be a bug, depending on your precise definition of what a bug is.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>high:</i> This should be fixed in the next release.<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: 2003-10-13 <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=4d76ca6658d4d557f1525e791cdb8910b5af4177">4d76ca6658d4d557f1525e791cdb8910b5af4177</a> (0.54)<br>
<p>
There are persistent reports of PuTTY's port forwarding not working
with SMB connections, although there are just as many reports of it
working fine. Thanks to Chip Killian's report of this bug and some
detective work with netstat, I think I've tracked down the cause of
this problem.

<p>
When PuTTY's network layer is asked to open a listening socket for
connections from localhost only, it actively refuses any connections
that don't come from a loopback source address. This was because I
was told that at least some Windows systems implement "the weak end
system model", in which any packet coming in to the system with a
destination address the machine believes it has will be accepted. In
other words, if I construct a packet with my own source address (say
10.1.2.3) and destination 127.0.0.1, and if I convince my IP layer
to send it to your machine's Ethernet MAC address, then your machine
might actually accept the connection, send back responses to my MAC
address with 127.0.0.1 as the source address, and then I've managed
to make a connection to one of your machine's <em>internal</em> services
from outside. PuTTY's deliberate check that loopback connections
come from an actual loopback address largely defeats this attack: if
I put 127.0.0.1 as the source address of your packets, I might still
get your machine to believe the first SYN, but all its replies will
be sent internally and won't come back to me.

<p>
Unfortunately, at least some versions of Windows connect to a SMB
share on 127.0.0.1 in such a way that the source of the connection
appears to be one of the machine's <em>other</em> IP addresses - and
hence PuTTY will reject the connection and refuse to forward it.

<p>
To fix this, I suppose PuTTY will need to find out what IP addresses
the machine believes it owns, so that it can accept connections from
any of those. If anyone wants to save me some manual-grubbing by
letting me know how to do that conveniently, it would be helpful.

<p>
<em>Update:</em> we have implemented a fix as of the 2003-10-13
snapshot. It would be helpful if someone could tell us whether it
makes SMB forwarding work.
