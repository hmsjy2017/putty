<b>summary</b>: Deferred key decryption in Pageant<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>depends</b>: <a href="pageant-named-pipe.html">pageant-named-pipe</a><br>

<p>
It would be nice if Pageant could support a mode in which it examines
a public key file at startup and immediately starts advertising the
key to clients, but doesn't actually decrypt the key (hence, does not
prompt for a passphrase either) until the first time it's called on to
actually generate a signature. Then it would decrypt the key and load
it properly.

<p>
On Windows, this almost certainly depends on
<a href="pageant-named-pipe.html">pageant-named-pipe</a>.
Also, depending on whether it turns out to be feasible to separate the
GUI and agent-request message queues (see discussion in the linked
issue), we might have no option but to present not-yet-decrypted keys
only to clients using named-pipe IPC, and pretend to old-style
<code>WM_COPYDATA</code> clients that those keys aren't loaded at all.

<p>
2021-04: implemented, including old Windows clients' ability to work
with deferred decryption. (This won't work brilliantly if multiple old
clients make blocking requests simultaneously, but that can't be
helped.)
