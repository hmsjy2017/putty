<b>summary</b>: Context help causes WinHelp crash after PuTTY help files upgraded<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>semi-bug:</i> This might or might not be a bug, depending on your precise definition of what a bug is.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>taxing:</i> Needs external things we don&#x27;t have (standards, users etc)<br>
<p>
Invoking context help from within Windows PuTTY after the PuTTY help
files on a system have been replaced has been observed to cause
WinHelp to crash.

<p>
Since the crash occurs in <tt>winhelp.exe</tt>, it's almost certainly
a WinHelp bug, but perhaps there is something we can do to avoid
triggering it. We're out of ideas, though.

<p>
The symptoms I observed (on Win98SE, and also on 2000 when I had
access to it, IIRC) were:

<ul>
<li>When using new .HLP and .CNT files (e.g., downloaded into a new
   directory, alongside a new version of PuTTY such as a development
   snapshot), invoking context help consistently causes WINHELP.EXE to
   crash and leave a putty.TMP file lying around.
<li>However, invoking the Help file without context by pressing
   (say) the Help button on PuTTY's configuration dialog, or invoking it
   from a session's system menu, or from Explorer, works fine (and
   generates a hidden putty.GID file), and subsequently to that, context
   help works too.
<li>If all the files (including .GID) are moved to a different path,
   things break again.
<li>Deleting the hidden putty.GID file doesn't appear to cause other
   instances not to break, but it can break a previously-working
   installation if other help files are accessed in the meantime.
<li>The two installations can be copies of each other and still cause
   trouble.
</ul>

<p>
The precise crash (on Win98SE at least) is: "WINHLP32 caused an
invalid page fault in module WINHLP32.EXE at 0167:004099ba." (A
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%220167%3A004099ba%22">Google Groups search</a>
finds an apparently unrelated reference, so it's not just us.)

<p>
Things I've tried, in desperation:
<ul>
<li>Fiddling with the precise macro we pass to <code>HELP_COMMAND</code>.
Changing from <code>JI</code> to <code>JumpId</code>, or filling in the
first argument (<code>JI(`putty.hlp',`foo.bar')</code>) makes no
difference.
<li><a href="http://www.helpfulsolutions.com/undoc_3and4.html">This page</a>
claims there is an undocumented <code>uCommand</code> value to give to
<code>WinHelp()</code> - <code>HELP_TOPIC_ID</code> = 259 - which would
avoid the need to use the <code>JI</code> macro at all. However, I've had
no luck with it ("The topic does not exist. Contact your application vendor
for an updated Help file. (129)")
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?as_umsgid=VA.0000000d.03c8734a%40birdofprey">A newsgroup post</a> reports it as broken on Win98.
</ul>

<p>
<em>March 2019:</em> this is now moot, as we no longer ship the .HLP
file (since <a href="vuln-chm-hijack.html">vuln-chm-hijack</a>).
