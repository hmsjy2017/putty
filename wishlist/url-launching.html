<b>summary</b>: Launch URLs in the PuTTY window by clicking on them<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>depends</b>: <em><a href="scripting.html">scripting</a></em><br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>low:</i> We aren&#x27;t sure whether to fix this or not.<br>
<p>
One of the most common features we are asked for is the ability for
PuTTY to recognise URLs displayed in its terminal window, and pass
them to the configured default web browser when you click on them.

<p>
This is not a very well-specified feature, since it can be hard to
determine exactly where a URL ends and the following text begins.
Therefore, it would seem sensible to implement this as a script,
after we get a scripting language written. That way, the regular
expressions used for URL recognition would be available to the user
so that if they didn't quite work right they could easily be tweaked.

<p>
In the meantime, you might find
<a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/winurl/">WinURL</a>
a useful tool. It allows you to select a URL in PuTTY (automatically
copying it to the clipboard), and then click on the WinURL icon in
the System Tray (or press Windows-W), and have the URL automatically
launched for you.
It's not quite as good as a one-click launch, but it's a lot better
than pasting into a browser window by hand.

<p>
There is a third-party patch to PuTTY to add this feature, called
Nutty (see our <a href="../links.html">Links page</a>).
We won't be incorporating it into PuTTY as it doesn't take account of
several of our
<a href="https://tartarus.org/~simon/putty-snapshots/htmldoc/AppendixD.html">design principles</a>:
<ul>
<li>it isn't cross-OS portable (Windows-specific URL launching and
platform-independent URL finding are entangled in the same source
module)
<li>it uses global variables for per-session data
<li>it's written in C++
<li>it incorporates a regular expression matcher and hence increases
code size excessively
</ul>
