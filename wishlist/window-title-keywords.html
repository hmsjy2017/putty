<b>summary</b>: Variable expansion in configured window title<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>medium:</i> This should be fixed one day.<br>
<p>
Some sort of variable expansion in the window title as configured in
PuTTY, with keywords for things like hostname, username, and so on.

<p>
One slightly special keyword would be one expanding to whatever the
server set the window title to. (Some people have software that tracks
window titles, so would like a guaranteed-constant bit while allowing
the server to influence the title.) This would obviously require some
change to the default behaviour where a server-specified title
completely overrides what's in the configuration -- perhaps triggered
by the presence of this keyword.

<p>
(It seems a bit of a shame to invent yet another random incompatible
micro-language instead of adding variable expansion /
<a href="scripting.html">scripting</a> consistently across the entire
interface, but we're unlikely to get around to even designing the
latter any time soon.)
