<b>summary</b>: Potential malicious code execution via CHM hijacking<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>vulnerability:</i> This is a security vulnerability.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>high:</i> This should be fixed in the next release.<br>
<b>absent-in</b>: 0.51<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=67d3791de83569dd55b307b775087815ad0d9002">67d3791de83569dd55b307b775087815ad0d9002</a> 0.71<br>
<p>
Up to and including version 0.70, when you launched the online help in
any of the Windows PuTTY GUI tools, the tool would locate its help
file by looking alongside its own executable.

<p>
If you were running PuTTY from a directory that unrelated code could
arrange to drop files into (for example, running it directly from a
browser's default download directory), this means that if somebody
contrived to get a file called <code>putty.chm</code> into that
directory (for example, by enticing you to click on a download link
with that name) then PuTTY would believe it was the real help file,
and feed it to <code>htmlhelp.exe</code>. (This is a similar attack
vector to the previous <a href="vuln-indirect-dll-hijack.html">vuln-indirect-dll-hijack</a>.)

<p>
This is a vulnerability because HTML Help files (<code>.chm</code>)
can arrange in turn to run code of their choice, for example by
embedding an <code><OBJECT></code> HTML element that is a
Windows shortcut, plus Javascript to click it. See, for example, this
<a
href="https://gist.github.com/mgeeky/cce31c8602a144d8f2172a73d510e0e7">proof
of concept</a>.

<p>
As of 0.71, this is fixed by completely changing how the PuTTY tools
find their help file:
<ul>
<li>The standalone executables (i.e. the ones you might download into
a random directory in the first place) now <em>embed</em> the CHM
inside themselves as a custom Windows resource, and when you click the
help button, they write it out to a temporary file. Therefore, the CHM
is protected against malicious modification by the same Authenticode
signature that covers the rest of the binary.
<li>The executables contained in the MSI installer do not have that
custom resource, because that would waste disk space on multiple
copies of it. Instead, they consult a Registry entry created by the
installer itself, which points at the pathname where the installer
saved <code>putty.chm</code>.
</ul>
This means that there are now two versions of <code>putty.exe</code>:
one with an embedded help file and one without. If you're in doubt,
the About box tells you which one you're running.

<p>
Also, we have removed the first-generation Windows Help files
completely (<code>putty.hlp</code> and the separate contents file
<code>putty.cnt</code>), since they undoubtedly had the same issue and
are now obsolete.

<p>
If you had installed PuTTY via the normal MSI installer, or if you
were careful in any other way about where you downloaded the
standalone executable files to, then you should be safe from this
issue.

<p>
This vulnerability was found by Dolev Taler, as part of a
<a href="https://hackerone.com/putty_h1c">bug bounty programme</a> run under
the auspices of the EU-FOSSA project.
It has been assigned CVE ID <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9896">CVE-2019-9896</a>.
