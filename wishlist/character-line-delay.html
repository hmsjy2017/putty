<b>summary</b>: Configurable per-character and per-line delays<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>medium:</i> This should be fixed one day.<br>
<p>
We've had several requests for PuTTY to be able to impose rate
limiting on data sent to the backend (remote device) -- particularly
large pastes, but perhaps also interactive user input. When
implemented in terminal software (e.g., Hyperterminal), there is
traditionally a separate delay per-character and per-line (user
pressed Return, or similar). Delay is typically configured in
milliseconds.

<p>
This is apparently required for interoperation with some devices (for
instance, some Cisco devices require a line delay of 10ms).

<p>
We've had quite a few requests for this since we added the
<a href="serial-backend.html">serial backend</a>, but we also had
requests even before that existed (to work around broken terminal
servers that didn't pass on SSH flow control, among other things), so
it clearly shouldn't be tied to the serial backend. (Although a
per-character delay is likely to make the network backends hideously
inefficient when transferring large volumes of data, due to per-packet
overheads.)

<p>
(We do already have some mechanism for breaking up large pastes, as
experience has shown that even with a reliable, flow-controlled
network channel, sending massive amounts of data in one go tends to
cause trouble. But it's not configurable.)
