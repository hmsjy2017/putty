<b>summary</b>: Windows &quot;jump list&quot; duplicates items between pinned and recent lists<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>semi-bug:</i> This might or might not be a bug, depending on your precise definition of what a bug is.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>taxing:</i> Needs external things we don&#x27;t have (standards, users etc)<br>

<p>
Several people have reported that in PuTTY's implementation of the
Windows <a href="win7-jumplists.html">jump list</a>, when a session is
"pinned" to the taskbar, it does not disappear from the "Recent
Sessions" section (so it appears in two places).

<p>
We've reproduced this, and it's not ideal. Unfortunately it doesn't
seem to be under our control -- this part of the "jump list" feature
is managed by Windows. 
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd378396(v=VS.85).aspx">Microsoft's documentation</a>
says:

<blockquote>
The user might decide to pin one or more of the destinations provided in
the custom category to the Jump List. The list of pinned destinations is
not available to the application, but duplication is prevented by the UI
so no extra action is required of the application. Visually, a pinned
item moves to the Pinned section of the Jump List and disappears from
its original location.
</blockquote>

<p>
But Windows seems to be failing to do this here.

<p>
This aberrant behaviour is not apparent with other applications using
Jump Lists, such as Notepad and Internet Explorer. Not sure what the
significant difference is. The other apps are using the standard
Recent/Frequent categories, whereas PuTTY has a custom "Recent
Session" category.
