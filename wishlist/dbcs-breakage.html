<b>summary</b>: Double-byte character set (CJK, &amp;c) display is broken<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>semi-bug:</i> This might or might not be a bug, depending on your precise definition of what a bug is.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>medium:</i> This should be fixed one day.<br>
<p>
We've had a report that Korean display got a lot worse in the
snapshots between r5002 and r5003 <tt><000001c513c9$e63ae1e0$aa000059@ktd></tt>.

Looking at the code, I think I can see why this is happening. This
is to do with RDB's idea that when the user selects `use font
encoding' and a font with a DBCS encoding, the terminal code should
simply store the individual bytes in individual character cells and
rely on <code>do_text()</code> being passed a string of these so that <code>TextOut()</code>
can reconstitute pairs of DBCS bytes into double-width characters.

<p>
As far as I can tell, <code>terminal.c</code> does not mark the first byte of a
DBCS character stored in this way. Therefore, the mechanism is
fundamentally dependent on a <code>do_text()</code> run <em>happening</em> to begin at
the correct point mod 2! Hence the comment in the mail referenced
above, which said that there was already some breakage when the
cursor moved over a double-byte character - the half-character under
the cursor cannot be properly redrawn. Owing to <a href="font-overflow.html">font-overflow</a>,
though, when you move the cursor over a double-byte character we now
redraw a lot of text to the right of that as well, and if the cursor
is on the first half of the character then this is <em>bound</em> to be
incorrect mod 2; so the problem shows up a lot more readily. I'd bet
that the same breakage could have been seen in previous versions if
the window was covered and re-exposed when the cursor was in a
problem position.

<p>
A real fix for this would involve implementing proper DBCS support,
by detecting DBCS lead bytes in the <code>terminal.c</code> input data stream and
storing both bytes in the same character cell using the existing
<code>UCSWIDE</code> mechanism. I have occasionally wondered about doing this: I
envisage that we would co-opt the top half of the <code>unsigned long</code>
space (never used by any flavour of Unicode/UCS ever) to provide
more than enough fake character encodings for the purpose.

<p>
Of course, if we were going to support DBCSes in <code>terminal.c</code> it would
also be good to be able to support them <em>properly</em>, by translating
them to Unicode on input.

<p>
<em>Summary:</em> I think this has always been broken, and now it's merely
more obviously broken. I regret the effect on CJK users who had
found the previous behaviour worked just about well enough, but I
don't think a hurried fix is in the general interest.
</blockquote>

<p>
UTF-8 mode should work reasonably well. A workaround is to use UTF-8
if possible (perhaps via something such as
<a href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/luit/">luit</a> or
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">screen</a>).
