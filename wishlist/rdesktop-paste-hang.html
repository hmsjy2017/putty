<b>summary</b>: Paste from tunneled Remote Desktop session into PuTTY causes hang<br>

<p>
We've had a few reports that the following scenario causes PuTTY to hang
("Not responding"):
<ol>
<li>Set up a PuTTY session with a tunnel for a Remote Desktop session.
<li>Copy text from the Remote Desktop session.
<li>Paste it into the PuTTY session running the tunnel.
</ol>
Closing the Remote Desktop session apparently unwedges PuTTY.

<p>
This sounds like a classic deadlock. This looks plausible if Terminal
Services defers sending clipboard data over the network until it's
requested; PuTTY does all the operations involved in a paste without
explicitly checking for and dealing with any network activity.

<p>
It seems that the data is only hauled over the network once; if it's
pasted into another local applicaton and then pasted into the
tunnelling PuTTY without re-selecting, it works (at least with
XP Pro SP2 as the server).

<p>
However, we haven't been able to
reproduce it ourselves (with XP SP1). We've had one report that it
only happens when pasting from certain applications on the Remote
Desktop end (<a href="http://www.mirc.com/">mIRC</a> is one such),
which could explain that (or could just turn out to be a mistaken
correlation caused by the effect mentioned above).

<p>
Another workaround is apparently to paste into some other local
application and re-copy from there before pasting into PuTTY.

<p>
This deadlock can also show up when copying data from a tunnelled
X session and pasting into the PuTTY session doing the tunnelling;
this has been reported with Seagull Software BlueZoneX versions
7 and up.
