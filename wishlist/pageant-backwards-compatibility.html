<b>summary</b>: 0.61-style Pageant does not work with 0.60-style PuTTY<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>bug:</i> This is clearly an actual problem we want fixed.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>high:</i> This should be fixed in the next release.<br>
<b>present-in</b>: 0.61<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: r9264 <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=52e5dae242e331ae34106eb3cc260067902d091d">52e5dae242e331ae34106eb3cc260067902d091d</a> 0.62<br>
<p>
Pageant ensures that other concurrent users of the same Windows
machine do not connect to it by checking that a SID on the file
mapping object passed to it in each request matches its own. In 0.60,
it checked the SID against its default one, which caused some troubles
with Cygwin
(see <a href="cygwin-clobbers-pageant.html">cygwin-clobbers-pageant</a>)
which does something odd to the default SID. In 0.61, it was reworked
to check the SID against the one identifying the running <em>user</em>,
and all the Pageant clients were correspondingly modified to make that
SID the owner of the file mapping.

<p>
Unfortunately, this has the side effect that Pageant 0.61 will not
talk to PuTTY 0.60, and (perhaps even more importantly) not to any
other program that still uses 0.60's SID selection, such as WinSCP.

<p>
The fix is to allow Pageant to accept <em>either</em> the default or
user SID as the owner of the file mapping. We think this is still safe
in terms of keeping other users out of Pageant.
