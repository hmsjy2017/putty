<b>summary</b>: &quot;Default Settings&quot; can be launchable, leading to confusion<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>bug:</i> This is clearly an actual problem we want fixed.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>high:</i> This should be fixed in the next release.<br>
<b>absent-in</b>: 0.58<br>
<b>present-in</b>: 0.59<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: 2007-02-11 r7265 <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=5d76e00dac9220e8798e4d0f17a4069a58ae1667">5d76e00dac9220e8798e4d0f17a4069a58ae1667</a> (0.60)<br>
<p>
When PuTTY loads a saved session, it will under some circumstances
automatically launch it if it's launchable. "Launchable" used to
simply mean that it actually specified a host name to connect to,
but due to <a href="serial-backend.html">the serial port backend</a>
it's now a more complex criterion.

<p>
The original intention of the PuTTY configuration storage was that
"Default Settings" should never describe a session which is
launchable, which is why we don't permit a host name to be saved in
the default settings. (People occasionally complain about this.)

<p>
However, due to an oversight, it <em>is</em> now possible to have
Default Settings describe a launchable session: simply set
"Protocol" to "Serial", and have the "Serial line" box non-blank (as
it is by default). This leads to undesirable behaviour; in
particular, PuTTY launched with no arguments will try to start up
a session instead of bringing up the configuration dialog.

<p>
I'm not sure how best to fix this. Restricting what can be stored in
Default Settings so that even serial-based defaults are forced not
to be launchable seems to me like the wrong answer. Perhaps the
right answer is actually to go through the code and ensure that
Default Settings in particular is never automatically launched
<em>even if launchable</em>. If we do that, then perhaps we could
also repeal the restriction on having a default host name saved in
Default Settings.

<p>
<b>SGT, 2007-02-10</b>: Should now be fixed, by the method described
above: Default Settings may describe a launchable session but is
never actually launched unless PuTTY is sure the user really meant
it. In particular, merely starting PuTTY doesn't launch the session
described by DS, and neither does double-clicking DS from the saved
sessions menu. Hitting Open once you've loaded it still works, and
using "<code>-load</code>" still works. Also, as mentioned above,
I've relaxed the restriction on storing a host name in DS, on the
basis that since one type of launchable session is now permitted in
DS there's no reason not to permit the other too.

<p>
If you get into this situation, and can't upgrade permanently to 0.60
or later, the following workarounds are available:
<ul>
<li>Download 0.60, which does not suffer
from this problem. You will then be able to edit Default Settings so
that PuTTY 0.59 does not attempt to launch a serial connection.
(Although if you're using the serial backend, you are likely to need
to carry on using 0.60 or later in any case, as the serial
support is <a href="win-handle-double-free.html">prone to crashes</a>.)
</li>
<li>If you're happy editing the Registry:
<ol>
<li>Run <tt>REGEDIT.EXE</tt>.
<li>Go to <tt>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\Default%20Settings</tt>
<li>Change the value of the '<tt>Protocol</tt>' key from '<tt>serial</tt>'
to '<tt>ssh</tt>'.
</ol>
</li>
<li>If you don't mind <em>losing all your saved sessions</em>, you
can use <tt>putty -cleanup</tt>. See
<a href="http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.59/htmldoc/Chapter3.html#using-cleanup">the documentation</a>.
</li>
</ul>
