<b>summary</b>: Scripting support in PuTTY<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>depends</b>: <em><a href="mdpi.html">mdpi</a></em><br>

<b>priority</b>: <i>low:</i> We aren&#x27;t sure whether to fix this or not.<br>
<p> Many people would find it useful for PuTTY to have a general
scripting mechanism. There are a lot of uses for something like
this:

<ul>
<li>
Automating movement through menu systems on servers.
<li>
Assigning common commands to function keys.
<li>
For MUD users: being able to set up triggers so that PuTTY
automatically sends commands when particular events happen on the
server.
<li>
Chaining connections. For example, the recommended way to connect to
<a href="http://www.mono.org/">Monochrome BBS</a>
is to make a preliminary Telnet connection to a central server which
will tell you which of the usable machines has the lowest load, and
then to make a Telnet or SSH connection to that machine. A scripting
facility would allow PuTTY to do things like this automatically.
<li>
Remembering your password for you. (Obviously we don't recommend you
do this, on security grounds; but in one or two situations it might
be helpful.)
<li>
Implementing <a href="key-mapping.html">key-mapping</a> fully generally.
<li>
Performing arbitrary transformations on clipboard contents.
</ul>

<p>
We do have a scripting language half-way written for this purpose,
though it's unclear when (if) it will ever be finished.

<p>
A scripting language is liable to be a fairly big piece of code, so
the language interpreter might end up having to be implemented as a
DLL plugin. Hence this feature is dependent on us creating a DLL
plugin interface first.

<p>
It's been suggested by several people that using the underlying OS's
built-in scripting mechanisms might help.  A problem with this is that
it prevents PuTTY scripts being portable between OSes, which in turn
means that we can't use the scripting language to implement any of PuTTY
itself.
