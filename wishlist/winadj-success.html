<b>summary</b>: Bombing out with &#x27;Received SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_SUCCESS for &quot;winadj@putty.projects.tartarus.org&quot;&#x27;<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>semi-bug:</i> This might or might not be a bug, depending on your precise definition of what a bug is.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>high:</i> This should be fixed in the next release.<br>
<b>absent-in</b>: 0.60<br>
<b>present-in</b>: 2008-03-28 2008-12-01<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: r9185 <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=3a649ed4edf0248afdc4c67e44ef2cdd8f4d472a">3a649ed4edf0248afdc4c67e44ef2cdd8f4d472a</a> 2011-07-02 (0.61)<br>
<p>
We've had a few reports of SSH connections bombing out with the
following error message, reportedly under load:

<pre>PuTTY Fatal Error

(X)  Disconnected: Received SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_SUCCESS for
     "winadj@putty.projects.tartarus.org"

                      [   OK   ]</pre>

<p>
This message has only existed in PuTTY since the
<a href="flow-control.html">flow-control</a>
feature was implemented, which was after we released 0.60; so only
people using development snapshots, or third-party code incorporating
development code, should have seen this.

<p>
On the face of it, it looks like the SSH server -- which in all the
cases positively identified so far is "boks_sshd" -- is incorrectly
responding to our unilaterally-defined channel request message with
SUCCESS, which it should never do since it's something we made up. 
(<a href="https://tartarus.org/~simon/putty-snapshots/htmldoc/AppendixF.html#sshnames-channel">Our documentation</a>
mandates a FAILURE response, but that's only a restatement of the
RFC 4254 requirement for a FAILURE response to requests that
aren't understood -- we don't expect any server to specifically
handle this message.)

<p>
The maintainers of boks_sshd, foxt.com, acknowledged this server issue
(case 090916-090424). It was fixed in BoKS 6.5.4, released on June 2,
2010.

<p>
The obvious workaround for the behaviour of old versions of this
server behaviour is to just ignore the protocol error, and quietly
treat a (bogus) SUCCESS response to "winadj@putty" the same as a
FAILURE response -- it won't do any harm, since all we're interested
in is when the server replies; we don't actually care about the
content. So we did that.

<p>
Reports:
<ul>
<li>E2E34FB668D4874FA28658B489F40BB0028F47DA@BP1XEUEX706-C.bp1.ad.bp.com
  <br>Using "Portable PuTTY from the Xming project" (not our code)
  <br>but also seen with 2008-12-01:r8355
  <br>Server claims to be "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_4.3" -- however, if that
    were really true I'd have expected <em>many</em> more reports, and
    looking at the OpenSSH 4.3/p1/p2 source code I can't see how this
    can happen; apparently the server is actually "boks_sshd" from
    <a href="http://foxt.com/">foxt.com</a>.
  <br>Seems to happen readily -- a few "ls -ltr"s are sufficient to break it
  <br>Session log shows this happening the very first time we send one of
    our "winadj" requests; there aren't any ambiguities with multiple
    outstanding requests or anything like that.
<li><a href="http://trac.filezilla-project.org/ticket/3452">FileZilla
ticket #3452</a>
  <br>(but also reported with PSFTP 2008-03-28:r7934:
  E00B544DC95563489A6C43CCD571EDD304EF8AFB@somodd.som.umaryland.edu)
  <br>Reported as failure shortly after 1Gbyte of a file transfer.
<li>OF31BAE29C.9F8D62FE-ON862574FF.00743D6C-852574FF.007508E8@notes.wachovia.com
  <br>Again, server claims to be "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_4.3"
  <br>Again, shows up under light load ("ls -l" etc)
  <br>Again, session log shows it happens on the first "winadj" we send.
<li>b97d2a650908251029v6d08aadelab7db47c312b4841@mail.gmail.com
  <br>Again, shows up with "ls -l" type activity.
  <br>Server claims to be "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_3.8.1p1" but is in fact
    boks_sshd 6.0.
</ul>
