<b>summary</b>: Problems with various keyboard layouts / input methods<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>bug:</i> This is clearly an actual problem we want fixed.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>taxing:</i> Needs external things we don&#x27;t have (standards, users etc)<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>medium:</i> This should be fixed one day.<br>
<p>Problems with various keyboard layouts and input methods.
It would be hard for me to
debug these myself because I'd have to be able to work in the same
keymap as I was testing PuTTY in! If anybody can debug these
problems it would be greatly appreciated. (Although to get any fixes
rolled in, you'll probably need to convince us that it won't break for
anyone <em>else's</em> keyboard layout, and that it works across all
the Windows versions we support, because we just don't know enough
about internationalisation.)

<p>(Some of the items below have been on this list for a very long
time, and may in fact have been fixed. Please do let us know if so.)
<ul>
<li>
The
<a href="http://www.users.one.se/liket/svorak/">svorak</a> (Swedish
Dvorak) layout apparently gets a few control combinations wrong: ^W,
^V and ^Z.
<li>
On the Danish keyboard, apparently the tilde (~) is acting as a dead
key <em>and</em> generating a code in itself; so if you hit ~ and
then n, you get a ~ followed by a ñ.  (OSD: I can't replicate
this on Win2K with a Danish keymap.  I get only the ñ.)
<li>
There's been a report from a Korean user that Korean multi-byte
input doesn't work.
<li>
A German user has reported that Caps Lock is more like Shift Lock -
it affects a lot of keys other than alphabetics.
<li>
I believe there are also Eastern input mechanisms we don't handle
sensibly.
</ul>

<p>
There's a <a href="win-dead-keys.html">fix for dead keys</a> that
might make some of this stuff go away.
