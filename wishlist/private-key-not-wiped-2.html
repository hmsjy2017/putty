<b>summary</b>: Failure to scrub private keys from memory after use<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>vulnerability:</i> This is a security vulnerability.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>high:</i> This should be fixed in the next release.<br>
<b>present-in</b>: 0.63<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: 0.64 <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=65f69bca7363ceceeac515ae2a82b8f8adc6404d">65f69bca7363ceceeac515ae2a82b8f8adc6404d</a><br>
<p>
When PuTTY has sensitive data in memory and has no further need for
it, it should wipe the data out of its memory, in case malware later
gains access to the PuTTY process or the memory is swapped out to disk
or written into a crash dump file. An obvious example of this is the
password typed during SSH login; other examples include obsolete
session keys, public-key passphrases, and the private halves of public
keys.

<p>
PuTTY 0.63 and earlier versions, after loading a private key from a
disk file, mistakenly leak a memory buffer containing a copy of the
private key, in the function <code>ssh2_load_userkey</code>. The
companion function <code>ssh2_save_userkey</code> (only called by
PuTTYgen) can also leak a copy, but only in the case where the file it
tried to save to could not be created.

<p>
This applies to SSH-2 private keys only. It affects all tools in the
PuTTY suite which load or save private keys: PuTTY, Plink, PSCP,
PSFTP, Pageant and PuTTYgen. If any of those programs loads a
private key directly (rather than getting a signature from an SSH
agent such as Pageant) then they will have left information equivalent
to the private key in memory for their entire run.

<p>
(Of course, in Pageant's case, its <em>job</em> is to retain decrypted
private keys in memory, so this may not be so important. However, if
you ever told Pageant to delete a key from memory, it would not have
properly deleted it: it would still have retained a copy by mistake
due to this bug.)

<p>
PuTTY 0.64 fixes this bug in all the tools.

<p>
However, it is still <em>unavoidably</em> very dangerous if malicious
software is in a position to read the memory of your PuTTY processes:
there is still a lot of sensitive data in there which cannot be wiped
because it's still being used, e.g. session keys. And, as mentioned
above, Pageant retains decrypted private keys in memory for long
periods <em>on purpose</em> if you use it. So this fix somewhat
mitigates the risks of malicious access to your PuTTY processes'
memory, but no fix can eliminate those risks completely.

<p>
This issue is distinct from
<a href="private-key-not-wiped.html">private-key-not-wiped</a>,
which was in a different part of the code and was fixed in 0.63.

<p>
This bug has been assigned CVE ID <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-2157">CVE-2015-2157</a>.

<p>
Thanks to Patrick Coleman for spotting this issue and sending a
patch.
