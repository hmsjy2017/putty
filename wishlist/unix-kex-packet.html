<b>summary</b>: Unix: &quot;expected key exchange reply packet from server&quot; and crash<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>bug:</i> This is clearly an actual problem we want fixed.<br>
<b>present-in</b>: 0.54<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: 2005-01-08 <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=88c52fa85fdfa000a33d350138b10c8ebfa85965">88c52fa85fdfa000a33d350138b10c8ebfa85965</a> (0.58)<br>
<p>
We've had a couple of reports of the Unix version putting up the
"new host key" dialog, but then immediately putting up a
"PuTTY Fatal Error: expected key exchange reply packet from server"
error box over it and then crashing. I've reproduced this by
connecting to one of our correspondents' servers.

<p>
If the host key is already in the database, the connection goes
through fine. The fault doesn't appear to happen with the Windows
version, nor with Unix plink.

<p>
<em>Workaround:</em> add the host key to the database first. (Apparently
this can be done by setting "close window on exit" to "never" in
the first session, or use
<tt><a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=blob;f=contrib/kh2reg.py;hb=HEAD">contrib/kh2reg.py</a></tt>
in PuTTY version control.)

<p>
<em>More detail:</em>
In PuTTY's SSH packet log, what appears to distinguish failing from
successful connections is that in the latter, PuTTY logs sending a
NEWKEYS before logging receiving one, whereas in the former, it
doesn't log sending one at all. So in Windows and Unix-plink
connections with and without the host key prompt, and Unix PuTTY
without the prompt, we get something like

<p><pre>Incoming packet type 31 / 0x1f (SSH2_MSG_KEXDH_REPLY)
[...]
Event Log: Host key fingerprint is:
Event Log: ssh-dss 1024 xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
Outgoing packet type 21 / 0x15 (SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS)
Incoming packet type 21 / 0x15 (SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS)</pre>

<p>
whereas in Unix PuTTY with the prompt, we have

<p><pre>Incoming packet type 31 / 0x1f (SSH2_MSG_KEXDH_REPLY)
[...]
Incoming packet type 21 / 0x15 (SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS)
Event Log: expected key exchange reply packet from server</pre>

<p>
while waiting for the user to respond to the prompt.

<p>Tracing the code indicates that the SSH code gets a DH reply
packet, goes to verify the host key, goes to put up a message box,
enters <tt>gtk_main()</tt>... and the next thing we know is that
<tt>ssh_receive()</tt> is prematurely invoked on the next packet
(NEWKEYS), re-entering <tt>do_ssh2_transport()</tt> and looking for a
DH reply packet again (and failing). So the messagebox isn't causing
enough blocking. Probably something about the way we're using Gtk.

</ul>

<p>
<b>SGT, 2005-01-07</b>: Simplest answer, I think, is to use
<code>sk_set_frozen()</code> to ensure that the SSH connection in
question doesn't accept any more data while we're in the middle of
asking the user about something.
