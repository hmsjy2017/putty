<b>summary</b>: Pageant keeps open handles on removeable media<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>semi-bug:</i> This might or might not be a bug, depending on your precise definition of what a bug is.<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: 2005-03-01 <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=d7b50f8066b835b348f0e0a952db2c73e812133b">d7b50f8066b835b348f0e0a952db2c73e812133b</a> (0.58)<br>
<p>
We've had a couple of reports (e.g. on
<a href="http://groups.google.co.uk/groups?selm=c3k42q%242936ve%241%40ID-30312.news.uni-berlin.de">comp.security.ssh</a>)
that the Pageant process tends to keep hold of a directory handle to
the directory of the last key loaded via the file selection GUI.

<p>
This causes trouble for people who keep keys on removeable media such
as USB memory sticks, as Windows won't let them unmount and remove the
device.

<p>
The following workarounds are said to work:
<ul>
<li>Load, or attempt to load, a second (dummy) key from somewhere else
such as a fixed drive using the file selection GUI.
<li>Don't use the file selection GUI at all - pass the path to the key
on the Pageant command line.
</ul>

<p>
We don't believe that the Pageant code itself keeps handles on
anything particularly, so we suspect that the file selection GUI is
keeping a handle behind our backs. The workarounds above bear out this
hypothesis.

<p>
<em>Update, 2005-02-28 (JTN):</em> I've implemented a wrapper to
<code>GetOpenFileName()</code> which maintains a separate CWD for
the file requester and for the process as a whole (which should appear
in snapshots >=r5413), so this <em>should</em> be fixed now. I
haven't tested it with anything that objects to having a process in a
particular directory, nor with anything potentially awkward like UNCs,
but the docs suggest it should work. (A simpler solution would have
been to use <code>OFN_NOCHANGEDIR</code>, but that would have changed
the UI behaviour.)
