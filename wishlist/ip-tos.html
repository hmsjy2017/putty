<b>summary</b>: Use of IP type-of-service field<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>low:</i> We aren&#x27;t sure whether to fix this or not.<br>
<p>
We've had a very few requests for the PuTTY suite to make use of the
IP type-of-service (ToS) field - apparently it does make a practical
difference to a few people using traffic shapers to sort
interactive/bulk traffic.

<p>
Some thought needs to be given to this: PuTTY terminal sessions are
obviously `interactive' traffic, PSCP/PSFTP are `bulk', but Plink
could be either depending on usage, as could random port-forwardings.
Also, we may not <em>want</em> to leak that sort of information about
an encrypted connection. So it would probably need to be configurable,
and off by default.

<p>

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q248611">Q248611</a>
(which indicates that on Win2K, a registry entry needs to be set to
allow user programs to set the ToS).

<p>
This probably can't be set on Windows <2000.

<p>
Need to make sure we understand how one is supposed to use this field
in today's world; I've a feeling that several sets of semantics may
have come and gone over the years.
