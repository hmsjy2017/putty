<b>summary</b>: DoS if many Unicode combining characters are written to the terminal<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>vulnerability:</i> This is a security vulnerability.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>high:</i> This should be fixed in the next release.<br>
<b>absent-in</b>: 0.57<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=da1c8f15b1bc14c855f0027cf06ba7f1a9c36f3c">da1c8f15b1bc14c855f0027cf06ba7f1a9c36f3c</a> 0.71<br>
<p>
Up to and including version 0.70, PuTTY's terminal emulator supports
remembering an unlimited number of combining characters in each
character cell of the terminal. They may not be displayed very
clearly, but PuTTY will at least <em>try</em> to display them, and
will remember them for copy and paste purposes.

<p>
Unfortunately, this means that sending a long unbroken string of
combining characters to the terminal causes it to allocate potentially
unlimited amounts of memory. Moreover, the combining characters are
stored as a linked list, leading to quadratic-time behaviour, so the
terminal will slow down to the point of unusability as well.

<p>
In other words, any process that can arrange to write Unicode text output
to your terminal – even if it consists of printable characters only –
can perform a denial-of-service attack. This could be as simple as
leaving a text file somewhere for you to <code>cat</code>.

<p>
As of 0.71, this is fixed by limiting each character cell to at most
32 combining characters. After that, the contents of the cell become
U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER with no combining characters at all.

<p>
CVE ID <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9897">CVE-2019-9897</a> has been assigned for the collection
of terminal DoS attacks fixed in 0.71, including this,
