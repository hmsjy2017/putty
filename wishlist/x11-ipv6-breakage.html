<b>summary</b>: Reported X forwarding breakage due to IPv6<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>bug:</i> This is clearly an actual problem we want fixed.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>taxing:</i> Needs external things we don&#x27;t have (standards, users etc)<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>medium:</i> This should be fixed one day.<br>

<p>
We've had a couple of reports of X forwarding breakage related to
IPv6.

<p>
One report implied that X forwarding in PuTTY broke right after we
integrated the IPv6 code. Presumably the IPv6 changes have had some
sort of side effect on the local network connection between PuTTY
and the X server, but it isn't clear what since we haven't been able
to reproduce it.

<p>
We received this report by email
(<code><41E6F012.2040105@ressukka.net></code>). Details
include:

<ul>
<li>
The symptom at the remote end is that X applications report "X
connection to localhost:10.0 broken (explicit kill or server
shutdown)".
<li>
The X display in the PuTTY configuration is the PuTTY default
(equivalent to <code>localhost:0</code>). The reporter found that
requesting <code>127.0.0.1:0</code> instead worked, although not
consistently. (This leads me to wonder whether
"<code>localhost</code>" might have been resolving to an IPv6
address on the system in question.)
<li>
The X server was xorg 6.8.1 from Cygwin.
<li>
Windows version was XP SP2.
</ul>

<p>
Another report
(<code><4E2CCFB2C8CC5244939D17374DC28E0003444974@ing.com></code>):

<ul>
<li>Windows XP Pro SP1
<li>Connecting via an HTTP proxy
<li>Same symptom ("explicit kill or server shutdown")
<li>Using <code>127.0.0.1:0</code> doesn't help at all
<li>X server doesn't matter (tried Exceed, Cygwin)
<li>Still happens with "latest development snapshot" (2006-04)
<li>Uninstalling IPv6 made the problem go away
<li>PuTTY Event Log entries (approximate):
<br><pre>2006-04-12 12:44:08 Received X11 connect request from 127.0.0.1:39241
2006-04-12 12:44:08 Opening X11 forward connection succeeded
2006-04-12 12:44:08 Forwarded X11 connection terminated</pre>
</ul>

<p>
If anyone is able to reproduce this or shed some light on possible
causes, we'd be grateful.
