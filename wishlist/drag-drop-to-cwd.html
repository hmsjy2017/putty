<b>summary</b>: Drag and drop support (the hard version)<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>mayhem:</i> Probably impossible<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>low:</i> We aren&#x27;t sure whether to fix this or not.<br>
<p>
<a href="drag-drop.html">drag-drop</a> suggests, among other UI possibilities, the idea
that dragging and dropping a file into a PuTTY SSH terminal window
from the Windows Explorer should automatically SFTP it to the server
via a spare SSH channel.

<p>
When users have asked for this, one particular request they've often
made is that the file should be dropped into the <em>current
directory</em> of the remote shell, so that you'd have it instantly
available in the directory your prompt was sitting in anyway, and not
have to go and fish it out of some standard designated uploads
directory.

<p>
That, unfortunately, is not even feasible in <em>theory</em>, because
there's no reliable way for PuTTY to determine what the currect
directory of the remote shell <em>is</em>.

<p>
There are lots of ways to do it <em>un</em>reliably, or via setup from
the user. You could imagine, for example, parsing the user's shell
prompt to extract the cwd from it â€“ but not all users put their
cwd in their shell prompt, and the ones who do often format it
differently. And even telling what is a shell prompt and what is not,
from just a terminal data stream, needs more human interpretation than
you'd guess. At best you might make this work, <em>ish</em>, most of
the time, for a shell account that uses some fixed prompt format, say
the default one in a clean Ubuntu login account.

<p>
More ambitiously, we could define some additional terminal escape
sequence that is used by the shell to communicate its cwd (or rather,
to communicate its <em>preferred upload directory</em>), and if a user
wanted this feature, they'd have to set up some shell configuration
that emitted that sequence every time the cwd changed. But the number
of ways that could go wrong, from subshells of a different type to
security hazards if the wrong server-side process was able to emit
that sequence, don't bear thinking about.

<p>
So this one goes in at Mayhem difficulty. It's just not feasible.
