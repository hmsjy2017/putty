<b>summary</b>: PuTTY doesn&#x27;t permit half-closed connections<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>bug:</i> This is clearly an actual problem we want fixed.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>medium:</i> This should be fixed one day.<br>
<b>present-in</b>: 0.58<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: r9280 <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=5848c8cc3d5531233540cba33802a22fe6d49439">5848c8cc3d5531233540cba33802a22fe6d49439</a> (0.63)<br>
<p>
By and large, where there are full-duplex connections in PuTTY, it
doesn't currently support the notion of a <em>half-closed</em>
connection - that is, end-of-file has been indicated in one direction,
but data is still flowing in the other direction. This applies to
actual TCP sockets and also SSH channels.

<p>
What usually happens is that PuTTY abruptly closes a socket/channel as
soon as it sees EOF in either direction.

<p>
I suspect this is leading to data loss in some circumstances (so may
be a/the cause of <a href="portfwd-corrupt.html">portfwd-corrupt</a>).

<p>
What probably needs to be done is to decouple EOFs in either
direction, and to sprinkle use of <code>shutdown()</code> and EOF
notifications such as <code>SSH1_MSG_CHANNEL_CLOSE</code> and
<code>SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_EOF</code> throughout the code. This is a
noticeable amount of work.

<p>
<b>SGT, 2011-08-31</b>: This also affects Plink in some circumstances.
For instance, if you do a command along the lines of
<pre>plink myhost 'cat > thing' < thing</pre>
then Plink can (intermittently, depending on the server's window
behaviour) accidentally send the <code>SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_EOF</code>
<em>before</em> the rest of the data in the channel's outbuffer. This
could be sort-of-fixed by setting the <code>pending_close</code> flag
in <code>ssh_special</code> rather than immediately sending the EOF
message, but that's only a partial fix since it would cause sending of
CLOSE rather than EOF. I think it would be better to treat that as
part of the full revamp described here, and fix it in a unified way.

<p>
While I'm here, another thing we would have to work out is when to
<em>break</em> the rule about EOFs being independent in each
direction. GUI PuTTY, for instance, <em>cannot</em> generate an EOF
from client to server, since there's no UI action to cause one; for
that case we'd have to adopt a rule that has more or less the effect
of the current behaviour, in the assumption that that's what login
sessions generally expect.

<p>
Another possibly relevant issue is
<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1818">this bug</a>
which I raised against OpenSSH last year. If our channel-closing
behaviour changes so that the sending of EOF is decoupled from sending
the first of the CLOSE messages which actually destroy the channel
itself, it would make it more convenient to work around that ambiguous
aspect of the ssh-connection protocol by waiting until we've seen
replies to all our winadj requests before sending the actual CLOSE.

<p>
<b>SGT, 2011-09-13</b>: just committed r9279 and r9280, which
<em>should</em> fix these issues throughout the code base. However,
it's quite likely I've made a mistake or two somewhere, since it was
quite a complicated fix.
