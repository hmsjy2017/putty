<b>summary</b>: Support more SSH public key fingerprint formats <br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>medium:</i> This should be fixed one day.<br>
<p>
PuTTY currently only supports one format for displaying SSH public key
fingerprints (used when
<a href="https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/htmldoc/Chapter2.html#gs-hostkey">verifying host keys</a>);
this is the traditional set of hex octets calculated with the MD5 hash
function specified by section 4 of
<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4716.txt">RFC4716</a> (for instance
<tt>ssh-rsa 1024 7b:e5:6f:a7:f4:f9:81:62:5c:e3:1f:bf:8b:57:6c:5a</tt>).

<p>
New versions of OpenSSH (from
<a href="https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html#6.8">6.8</a>) default
to displaying a different, base64-format fingerprint for certain keys, with
current versions calculated using the SHA-256 hash (for instance
<tt>SHA256:mVPwvezndPv/ARoIadVY98vAC0g+P/5633yTC4d/wXE</tt>).

<p>
Since modern OpenSSH takes some persuasion to display fingerprints in
the old format, and we should be moving away from the weak MD5 hash
anyway, PuTTY should support displaying fingerprints in this new
format, as well as continuing to display the old format for backward
compatibility.

<p>
We'd have to work out a UI for this. The obvious option is to display
the fingerprint in all known formats in the host-key verification
dialog; this will make the dialog even more intimidating, and could
get unwieldy if we ever have <a href="bubble-babble.html">more than two</a>.
A more complicated option would be to have a dropdown or buttons or
something on the host-key dialog to let the user choose among the
available formats; this probably implies a global setting to set the
default (and PuTTY isn't currently very good at global settings).

<p>
(Should you need to get an MD5 fingerprint out of modern OpenSSH in
the meantime, you need to run a command like
<pre>ssh-keygen -E md5 -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub</pre>
on the relevant server.)

<p>
Some places where key fingerprints are currently used, so that extra
UI complexity would need to be designed and implemented:
<ul>
<li>The GUI dialog box (both Windows and GTK) asking for a host key
confirmation. Obvious possibilities include a dropdown list of
fingerprint types, or simply listing all the known ones in a huge
info-dump.
<li>The corresponding console message, which can't provide a dropdown
list. Huge info-dump is one option; something you can type at the
interactive prompt to provide a different fingerprint format is
another.
<li>The readonly edit box displaying the fingerprint in Windows (GUI)
PuTTYgen. The obvious approach here is to have an option in the menu bar
that selects the format.
<li>The GUI key list window in Windows Pageant. That window doesn't
have a menu bar at the moment, but cluttering the window with a set of
radio buttons seems a bit intrusive. Perhaps we should add a menu bar.
<li>The fingerprint output mode in Unix (command-line) PuTTYgen.
Probably we do this one by making <code>-O fingerprint</code> and its
synonym <code>-l</code> use the current default fingerprint style, and
then add extra explicit modes like <code>-O fingerprint-md5-hex</code>
or <code>-O fingerprint-sha256-base64</code>.
<li>The fingerprints in the output of <code>pageant -l</code> on Unix.
A command-line option is the obvious way to select these.
<li>The idiom on Unix Pageant's client command line that lets you
select one of the currently loaded keys by typing a prefix of its
fingerprint.
<li>The configuration option in PuTTY itself which allows you to enter
the fingerprint of a host key you want PuTTY to accept. We'd have to
accept fingerprints in all formats, and do it in some way that ensured
they were unambiguous (no fingerprint intended to be type X should be
accepted on the grounds that it matched some key's type-Y
fingerprint).
<li>The diagnostic message in PuTTY's Event Log. That's text-only (and
also goes to log files), so once a fingerprint has been written into
it, it's too late to rewrite it in a different style. Perhaps that one
should just print all available fingerprint types.
<li>Diagnostic messages in Unix Pageant (only relevant in debug mode,
so not vital).
</ul>

<p>
We have been dragging our feet about this, as the new OpenSSH scheme
has some disadvantages, principally that it is harder to compare by
hand and read out over the phone, as it makes no concession to the
possibility of confusing homographs (letter-<tt>l</tt> versus
number-<tt>1</tt>, <tt>O</tt>-vs-<tt>0</tt> etc).

<p>
We did half-work-out an alternative scheme based on the
the Uniform Data Fingerprint (UDF) scheme described in
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-hallambaker-udf/">draft-hallambaker-udf</a>.
That scheme has been designed for readability while remaining relatively
compact, to minimise the risk of ambiguity, and to allow easy
migration to new hash algorithms (the first character encodes the
algorithm); it would give fingerprints of the form
<tt>MBQPX-76TZY-NXTKU-WJZIM-LH4T2-IYQU6</tt>.
Our effort got as far as a half-written spec and some minimal
proof-of-concept code, both unpublished. (However, the opportune
moment to push this as a replacement for OpenSSH's scheme has
clearly passed.)
