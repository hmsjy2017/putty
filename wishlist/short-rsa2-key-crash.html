<b>summary</b>: Short RSA2 key causes PuTTY crash<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>bug:</i> This is clearly an actual problem we want fixed.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>medium:</i> This should be fixed one day.<br>
<b>present-in</b>: 0.53b 2003-11-03<br>
<p><pre>&quot;If I create a really short RSA2 key (I used 256 bits) it is generated and
accepted OK, but the PuTTY code (CVS head, 22:00 GMT yesterday) segfaults.&quot;

More detail: &lt;20031101102009.GA29907@chiark.greenend.org.uk&gt;
(includes suspected root cause)

(I&#x27;ve tested that DSA and RSA1 keys don&#x27;t suffer from the same problem.)

-----
More analysis:

&gt; Looking at rsa2_sign(), if the RSA modulus of the key is too small, we
&gt; can&#x27;t fit in the padding, ASN1 goop and hash, but the loop is merrily
&gt; attempting to cram it all in anyway, overrunning the malloced block and
&gt; (apparently) causing fruity stack badness.

*nods* Yes, I managed to trace that much myself. The trouble is not
that I don&#x27;t know the cause of the problem, but more that I don&#x27;t
know how best to fix it.

[...] the plausible options are (a) reject the key when PuTTY attempts
to load it, or (b) return failure and a useful error message from
the sign operation. I&#x27;m undecided between those two; (a) is nice
from the point of view of detecting and reporting any error
condition at the earliest possible moment, but (b) feels a little
more robust since the check can be performed in the _same_ code that
will then go and use the buffer space - so rather than having to
keep two pieces of similar-looking code in sync, there&#x27;s just one
piece of code which is likely to keep naturally in sync with itself.
Either one, however, requires some infrastructure change to support,
which is why I didn&#x27;t fix it before the 0.54 release.

(Quite why anyone&#x27;s using 256-bit keys _anyway_ is beyond me, but
these days no weird user behaviour is a surprise to me.)

BJH21: I&#x27;ve added an assert() to the code so that the explosion when trying
       to use a too-short key is more controlled. The signature of the
       assertion failure looks something like this:

         Assertion failed!

         Program: putty.exe
         File: ..\sshrsa.c
         Line: 793
         
         Expression: 1 &lt;= nbytes - 20 - ASN1_LEN

       It occurs to me that PuTTYgen really should warn (and maybe fail)
       when asked to generate an ssh-rsa key that can&#x27;t possibly be used.
