<b>summary</b>: The mythical DLL Plugin Interface<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>blocks</b>: <em><a href="cooked-printer.html">cooked-printer</a></em> <em><a href="cryptoapi.html">cryptoapi</a></em> <em><a href="portfwd-ftp.html">portfwd-ftp</a></em> <em><a href="scripting.html">scripting</a></em> <em><a href="unicode-normalisation.html">unicode-normalisation</a></em><br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>low:</i> We aren&#x27;t sure whether to fix this or not.<br>
<p>
Since we know a lot of people really appreciate PuTTY's small size,
we try to preserve that small size. Unfortunately, there are some
features which simply can't be implemented without a <em>lot</em> of
code.

<p>
Therefore, we would like PuTTY to have an interface that allows
plugins in the form of DLLs. These plugins would be completely
optional; if PuTTY didn't find any plugins when it started up, it
would go ahead and run without them, and you just wouldn't get any
of the features supported in the plugins. If you needed to fit PuTTY
into a small space (such as a floppy), you could include only those
plugins you really needed - or none at all.

<p>
Quite how this plugin interface should fit together is unclear. In
particular, since methods of DLL linkage and dynamic loading tend to
be very platform-specific, it would be hard to design a plugin
interface which would allow us to port the plugins bodily to other
platforms (when we eventually get round to doing any ports).

<p>
