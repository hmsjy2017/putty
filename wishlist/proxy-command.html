<b>summary</b>: Proxying through arbitrary command (e.g. another SSH session)<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>

<b>fixed-in</b>: 2006-08-27 r6808 <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=cda522186a8ca486b181a764884fd15e079783e5">cda522186a8ca486b181a764884fd15e079783e5</a> (0.59)<br>
<p>
We occasionally get asked to implement use of arbitrary commands as
proxy-like transports, similar to the ProxyCommand feature of
<a href="http://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH</a>.

<p>
We also get requests to use an SSH server as a `proxy'. These should
probably be considered an instance of the general case. Treating SSH
as just another proxy type like HTTP etc isn't feasible - we have
pages of configuration UI for the `main' session, and all this would need
to be configurable for the `proxy' session too. In the current model
all this would have to be crammed in or under the Proxy panel somehow.
With a ProxyCommand feature you <em>could</em> use Plink as a
transport and configure it as usual.

<p>
It's less obvious how a ProxyCommand-type feature should be configured
on Windows than on Unix, as Windows is much less command-oriented
(where OpenSSH usually runs). Also, implementation in a manner
compatible with Win95/98 (which lack useful pipes) might be tricky.
(see also design discussion in
<a href="win-command-prompt.html#puttycyg">win-command-prompt</a>)

<p>
A partial solution is to set up a local (e.g.) SOCKS server which will
run whatever bizarre command you need. You can then use PuTTY's
existing proxy facilities. I don't know whether there is a convenient
product that provides a SOCKS front end and runs arbitrary commands at
the back end, but there clearly should be. This does of course require
that your SOCKS server has been started up in the first place, but
since (if sufficiently clever) it can defer doing anything tricky
until it's needed, that needn't be an onerous requirement.

<p>
With <a href="portfwd-dynamic.html">portfwd-dynamic</a>,
this approach would assist those people who need to use
an SSH server as a proxy.

<p>
<b>SGT, 2006-08-26</b>: I've just implemented this for Windows (Unix
has supported it since 2003) and it seems to be basically working.
