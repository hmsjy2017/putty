<b>summary</b>: The Arcfour cipher isn&#x27;t supported<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>low:</i> We aren&#x27;t sure whether to fix this or not.<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: 2005-09-04 <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=bcf547a069e2436abbea62e1f0d658178394a68b">bcf547a069e2436abbea62e1f0d658178394a68b</a> (0.59)<br>
<p>
PuTTY doesn't support the "arcfour" (RC4) cipher in SSH-2.  Arcfour is
notable for being substantially faster than any cipher that PuTTY
currently supports.  Unfortunately, the way it's specified for SSH-2,
without discarding the first 1024 bytes of keystream, it's rather
weaker than it could be (though not dangerously so).  On the other
hand, not being a CBC-mode block cipher, it doesn't suffer from the
problems described in <a href="ssh2-cbc-weakness.html">ssh2-cbc-weakness</a>.

<p>
Using arcfour (or any other stream cipher) in SSH-1 would be a very bad
idea.  The lack of a MAC makes it very easy for an attacker to modify
the data stream.

<p>
<b>Update:</b> Ben Harris has written an Internet-Draft
(draft-harris-ssh-arcfour-fixes, now
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4345.txt">RFC 4345</a>)
describing a way of using Arcfour reasonably securely with SSH-2, and
PuTTY now implements this. Note that this document defines the
"arcfour256" and "arcfour128" ciphers; PuTTY still does not support
the less secure "arcfour" cipher, and we have no plans to make it
do so.

<p>
(Support was first added in 2005-04-22, but uonly under private
names defined in an earlier draft:
"arcfour256-draft-00@putty.projects.tartarus.org" and so on.
Only from 2005-09-04 do we support the IETF names, which also
appear in OpenSSH from 4.2.)
