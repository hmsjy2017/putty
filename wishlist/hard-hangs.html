<p>
Apparently, for some people, PuTTY randomly becomes unresponsive with
Win2000/XP.

<p>
We've been getting rare but persistent reports of this for a while,
but there seems to have been a rash of them recently (Feb 2004). None
of us have ever seen this, so we're going to need some help if we're
to stop it happening.

<p>
Common characteristics of the reports we've had:
<ul>
<li>When one PuTTY hangs, they all hang, including any new instances
attempted (once they get to opening a terminal window), until the
system is restarted. But other applications on the same system are
unaffected.
<li>When trying to close PuTTY via the task manager, one receives a
message like "This program cannot be closed. If it is being debugged,
please resume it or close the debugger first."
<li>It doesn't seem to be correlated with any particular event - it
can occur hours into an established connection.
<li>It's claimed that the PuTTY backend is still functional (sending
keepalives, etc).
<li>Looks like it only happens with SSH (1 and 2)
<li>May be absent in 0.49?
</ul>

<p>
If I had to make a guess, I'd investigate some of the trickery we use
to get noise for random numbers. My notes also suggest that I thought
someone thought that sound might be implicated, but I can't find any
evidence for that now.

<p>
Once the system has got into this state, an SSH packet log of a new
session which hangs might be useful, so we can infer exactly where
it's hanging and what it might be doing (since there's been a
suggestion that it's some way into the SSH protocol).

<p>
If someone can debug one of the hanging PuTTY processes and tell us
where it's got stuck, that would be good too.
<br><em>Update, 2004-03-17</em>: someone did this, and PuTTY is
hanging in <code>noise_get_light()</code>, around the call to
<code>GetSystemPowerStatus()</code>.

<p>
<em>Update, 2004-03-17</em>: one of our correspondents has been trying
a version of the development code (more or less equivalent to 0.54) with
the <code>GetSystemPowerStatus()</code> call disabled, and has reported
that the problem seems to have gone away.

<p>
This source of noise has now been removed as of 2004-03-18 (there were
<a href="ntpd-slowdown.html">other good reasons</a> too).
Please let us know if this appears to solve (or not!) the problem.

<p>
(Perhaps we've been getting more reports recently because modern BIOI /
Windows versions / whatever are more upset by frequent calls to the
APM BIOS or whatever it is than older systems?)
