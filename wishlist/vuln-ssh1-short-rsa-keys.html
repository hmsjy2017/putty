<p>
All versions of the PuTTY suite prior to 0.72 have a memory corruption
bug in SSH-1 key exchange, which might lead to a security
vulnerability.

<p>
During SSH-1 key exchange, the server sends a packet containing an RSA
host key and an RSA server key. PuTTY will allocate a buffer the size
of the larger key, and then write a random 32-byte session id into it,
before encrypting the session id with both keys in sequence.

<p>
The bug is triggered if a malicious server sends RSA host and server
keys which are both shorter than 32 bytes, in which case the allocated
buffer will also be less than 32 bytes, and the initial writing of the
session id will overrun the buffer.

<p>
We have no evidence that this can be exploited to cause remote code
execution. The data written into the too-small buffer is made up by
PuTTY, not by the server. But, on the other hand, we don't know that
it <em>can't</em> allow code execution.

<p>
The bug occurs before host key verification. (PuTTY verifies the host
key before performing <em>encryption</em> with it, but unfortunately,
not before the initial write into the buffer it's going to encrypt
in.) So a network attacker intercepting your connection could attack
PuTTY through this vulnerability before being detected as not the real
server.

<p>
This bug only affects the obsolete SSH-1 protocol, which is rarely used.
In PuTTY 0.68 and later, we
<a href="no-ssh1-fallback.html">no longer support</a>
automatic fallback to SSH-1 from SSH-2, so any saved session
configured to the default of SSH-2 will not be vulnerable to this
issue.

<p>
This vulnerability was found as part of a
<a href="https://hackerone.com/putty_h1c">bug bounty programme</a> run under
the auspices of the EU-FOSSA project; see
<a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/630462">#630642</a> in their
tracker.
