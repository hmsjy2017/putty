<b>summary</b>: Key list from agent used after free if server rejects signature after PK_OK<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>vulnerability:</i> This is a security vulnerability.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>high:</i> This should be fixed in the next release.<br>
<b>absent-in</b>: 0.53<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=45287b627d1b1c4db4c7bd485a5adcc63b8d608a">45287b627d1b1c4db4c7bd485a5adcc63b8d608a</a> 0.74<br>
<p>
When PuTTY tries to do public-key SSH authentication using a key held
in the SSH agent, it retrieves a list of the keys held in the agent,
and iterates through them one by one to see which one the server will
accept.
</p>

<p>
PuTTY first sends an <em>offer</em> message, containing just the
public key and no signature. If the server is unwilling to accept that
key as identifying the target user, it usually sends back a message
rejecting the offer, which saves the client the trouble of making a
pointless signature. So normally PuTTY iterates through the keys
making offers until it finds one (if any) that the server is willing
to accept, and then it generates a signature, and the server accepts
that signature.
</p>

<p>
However, it's also possible for the server to accept the key in
principle (replying positively to the initial offer) but then reject
the actual signature when it is presented. This can happen if the
client has a bug causing it to generate an invalid signature, or if
the server has a bug causing it to mistakenly <em>think</em> a
signature is invalid, or the server can even do it on purpose if it
wants to (e.g. to avoid allowing unauthorised clients to cheaply query
what keys are acceptable).
</p>

<p>
In this situation, PuTTY has a bug, because it has a single
<code>agent_response</code> variable storing the most recent response
sent by the SSH agent, and it leaves the key list in that variable
while iterating over it. So once the server responds positively to a
key offer, PuTTY asks the SSH agent to generate a signature, which
will be stored in the same <code>agent_response</code> variable, whose
previous contents (the key list) will be freed. Then, if the server
rejects the signature, PuTTY tries to go back to iterating over the
key list, failing to notice that it has now been freed.
</p>

<p>
We don't know that this can be exploited controllably, but it is
certainly a bug that can be deliberately triggered by a server (by
sending the <code>PK_OK</code> acceptance message to all offers, and
then rejecting all signatures).
</p>

<p>
0.74 fixes it, by having PuTTY immediately copy the key list out of
<code>agent_response</code> to somewhere safer. Then the later use of
<code>agent_response</code> to retrieve a signature does not collide
with the key list.
</p>

<p>
This vulnerability was discovered by the PuTTY team themselves in the
course of development.
