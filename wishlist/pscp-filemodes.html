<b>summary</b>: Control of file permissions in PSCP and PSFTP<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>medium:</i> This should be fixed one day.<br>
<p>
It would be nice if PSCP and PSFTP could allow user control of the
file permissions on files they create during transfers in both
directions.

<p>
As of r9260, permissions are preserved (modulo umask) by the Unix file
transfer tools, in both directions and in both SCP and SFTP protocols,
and the Windows tools use a non-configurable default (which is 0644
when we're speaking SCP, and unspecified in SFTP meaning that the
server will use <em>its</em> default).

<p>
It would be nice to have more control over this. Thoughts include:
<ul>
<li>
Ability to configure the default used on Windows.
<li>
Ability to inhibit propagation of existing permissions on Unix,
reverting to the Windows-like behaviour (and, as per previous bullet
point, ability to configure that default again).
<li>
Ability to <em>partially</em> propagate existing permissions on Unix.
For instance, sometimes you only want to propagate the one property of
whether a file is executable or not: imagine a situation in which on
one machine all your files are habitually <code>go-rwx</code> and on
another they're merely <code>o-rwx</code>. Copying executable files
like scripts from the one to the other would want to
translate <code>-rwx------</code> to <code>-rwxr-x---</code> and vice
versa, whereas copying non-executable files would want to
translate <code>-rw-------</code> to <code>-rw-r-----</code> and vice
versa. It's not clear how extensive needs in this area might be, and
hence what the configuration interface ought to look like. Perhaps a
good starting point would just be to add an option to normalise the
input permissions into one of <code>-rwxrwxrwx</code>
or <code>-rw-rw-rw</code>, and then let the umask take care of the
rest.
</ul>
