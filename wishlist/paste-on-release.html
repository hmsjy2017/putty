<b>summary</b>: PuTTY should paste when the paste button is released<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>low:</i> We aren&#x27;t sure whether to fix this or not.<br>
<b>absent-in</b>: 0.53b 2003-03-27<br>

<p>At present, PuTTY pastes text when it receives a button-down event for
whichever button is configured for paste.  Normally in Windows, actions
that are triggered by a click happen on the button-up event instead, and
moving the pointer out of the control being clicked on before the button-up
causes the action not to occur.  xterm does something slightly different, in
that it pastes on button-up, but doesn't seem to cancel if the pointer moves
outside the window. (We've had one request for the cancelling behaviour.)

<p><em>Update:</em> In fact, (Windows) PuTTY used to paste on release, and
it doesn't appear to be a deliberate change. Semi-bug? (It didn't have
the "cancel" behaviour, though.)
