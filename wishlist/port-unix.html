<b>summary</b>: Port to Unix<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>high:</i> This should be fixed in the next release.<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: 0.54<br>
<p>
It's currently being worked on. If you look at the nightly source
snapshots, you should find a <code>unix</code> subdirectory, which should
build you a Unix port of Plink, and also <code>pterm</code> - an
<code>xterm</code>-type program which supports the same terminal emulation
as PuTTY.

<p>
You can also build a Unix port of PuTTY itself. This isn't as useful a
thing on Unix as it is on Windows; its major value is as a pathfinding
effort for other ports. If anyone really has a use for it, we'd be
interested to know why :-)

<p>
Ports of <code>psftp</code>, <code>pscp</code>, and <code>puttygen</code>
are also now available.

<p>
We do not yet have a Unix port of Pageant (although another agent can be
used).

<p>
See also the <a href="../faq.html#faq-unix">FAQ</a>.

<p>
<em>Update:</em> as of 0.54, we think this is good enough to release.
