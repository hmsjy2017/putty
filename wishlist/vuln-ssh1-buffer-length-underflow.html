<p>
All versions of the PuTTY suite prior to 0.72 have an integer underflow
bug in the SSH-1 binary packet protocol, which might lead to a security
vulnerability.

<p>
The packet length field in an SSH-1 packet takes a value which is 5
more than the number of actual data bytes in the packet. If the server
sent a value less than 5, PuTTY's SSH-1 BPP code did not check it.

<p>
The resulting behaviour can vary between 32- and 64-bit builds of
PuTTY, and possibly also between Linux and Windows. Possibilities
include trying to allocate 2<sup>32</sup> bytes of memory and
terminating the program when that fails; trying to allocate
2<sup>32</sup> bytes of memory and consuming excessive OS resources
when that succeeds; passing a negative packet length to the rest of
the code, with further unpredictable results.

<p>
The bug can occur before host key verification, because the length
field is the same in all packets, encrypted or not. So in any
situation where a bad effect can be caused by this bug, a network
attacker intercepting your connection could cause the bad effect
before being detected as not the real server.

<p>
This bug only affects the obsolete SSH-1 protocol, which is rarely used.
In PuTTY 0.68 and later, we
<a href="no-ssh1-fallback.html">no longer support</a>
automatic fallback to SSH-1 from SSH-2, so any saved session
configured to the default of SSH-2 will not be vulnerable to this
issue.

<p>
This vulnerability was found as part of a
<a href="https://hackerone.com/putty_h1c">bug bounty programme</a> run under
the auspices of the EU-FOSSA project.
