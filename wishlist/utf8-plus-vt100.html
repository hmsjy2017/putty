<b>summary</b>: Simultaneous support for UTF-8 and enough ISO-2022 sequences for VT100 line drawing<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>low:</i> We aren&#x27;t sure whether to fix this or not.<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=6afa955a2ebf017755af134264a9423f54b9351c">6afa955a2ebf017755af134264a9423f54b9351c</a> (0.71)<br>
<p>
It's been suggested that it might be nice for PuTTY to support the
traditional VT100 line drawing behaviour (using ISO-2022 escape
sequences such as ESC ( B, ESC ) 0, SO and SI) in the same mode as
also supporting UTF-8. This would allow it to simultaneously support
legacy applications which ran on a VT100 and hence never output any
character value above 0x7F, and modern UTF-8-aware applications.

<p> Markus Kuhn <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html#term">thinks this
is wrong</a> ("While a terminal emulator is in UTF-8 mode, any ISO
2022 escape sequences [...] are ignored"), and I (SGT) am inclined
to agree, not least because the lack of easily corruptible ISO 2022
state is a useful defence against the confusion caused by
accidentally spewing binary files into your standard output. On the
other hand, I can see the potential utility of being able to run two
classes of plausibly common application without needing a mode
switch or <code>luit</code>. So I think that if we do this at all
(which isn't clear, hence priority "low"), it should be a
configurable option.

<p>
BJH points out that ISO 2022 requires that when we return from
UTF-8 (by ESC % @) the ISO-2022 state must be the same as when we
left, so if we did this then we'd have to keep a separate
pseudo-ISO-2022 state inside the UTF-8 mode (and discard it on ESC %
@, rather than preserving it until the next ESC % G).

<p><b>SGT, 2018-05-12</b>: a user sent a patch to implement this.
