<b>summary</b>: Batch mode for Windows PuTTYgen<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>low:</i> We aren&#x27;t sure whether to fix this or not.<br>
<p>
We're occasionally asked for a means of generating keys
non-interactively with the Windows version of PuTTYgen; for instance,
command-line arguments to specify the key type and so on.

<p>
There are a few wrinkles to this:

<ul>
<li>
<p>
For generating keys, interaction would still be required; there isn't
a source of sufficiently good randomness on Windows, so for key
generation we make the user generate some by waving the mouse around.
<p>
It would be possible to pare the interaction down to the bare minimum
(mouse-waving and perhaps passphrase entry); this might make PuTTYgen
suitable for use in an installation procedure, which specifies the
parameters and does something with the resulting keypair.
</li>
<li>
<p>
The randomness issue can be ignored for some operations, such as
automated format conversions. However, Windows PuTTYgen is currently
a GUI application, which makes using it from a batch file slightly
tricky. Normally, it will not block the batch file, but this can be
dealt with with <tt>START /WAIT</tt>; but it's still not clear how
such a setup might e.g. indicate errors (given that it probably won't
be able to interact with the console).
<p>
Since we already <em>have</em> a command-line PuTTYgen (for
Unix), it might be better to just port that to Windows as a console
application, disabling key generation on the way.
(The Unix version can and does run in a batch mode, as we
use <tt>/dev/random</tt> there, which is assumed to be a sufficiently
good source of randomness and doesn't require us to interact with the
user.)
</li>
</ul>
