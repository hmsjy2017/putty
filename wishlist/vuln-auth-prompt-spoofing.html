<b>summary</b>: Authentication prompts can be spoofed by a malicious server<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>vulnerability:</i> This is a security vulnerability.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>high:</i> This should be fixed in the next release.<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=514796b7e421327f2291571179e8657a07ace14d">514796b7e421327f2291571179e8657a07ace14d</a> 0.71<br>
<p>
Up to and including version 0.70, the PuTTY tools had no way to
indicate whether a piece of terminal output was a genuine
user-authentication prompt (such as a prompt for a password, or for an
SSH private key passphrase), or whether it was a faked version sent by
the server after PuTTY's authentication phase had already completed.

<p>
For example, suppose that a malicious server let you log in without
any authentication at all, and then started the session by sending
text that looked exactly like PuTTY prompting you for your private key
passphrase. If you didn't know for sure that you <em>didn't</em>
expect that prompt, the server might trick you into entering your
passphrase, which should not have been sent to any remote server.

<p>
If the server had also acquired a copy of your encrypted key file
(which, for example, you might have considered safe to copy around
<em>because</em> it was securely encrypted), then this would give it
access to your private key.

<p>
This is a user-interface weakness rather than the usual kind of
software vulnerability, so it requires a user-interface fix. It's also
difficult to fix because the Unix terminal model gives the server so
much control over what is displayed. For example, it wouldn't be
enough for PuTTY to display a separator line between the real
authentication prompts and the start of the main session, because the
server could immediately send escape sequences that moved the cursor
back up by a line and erased the separator! If you looked away from
the screen and didn't catch the (probable) rapid flicker, you might
easily miss that completely, and then the separator line would have
been useless.

<p>
As of 0.71, we're using the following combination of strategies to
distinguish legitimate from fake authentication prompts.

<p>
<b>In GUI PuTTY</b>: any line of the terminal containing data that was
legitimately emitted by the local PuTTY during SSH connection setup is
marked with what our code describes as a ‘trust sigil’. A trust sigil
must be something the server can't cause PuTTY to display by sending
escape sequences. We've chosen a small copy of the PuTTY program's
icon, because it's multicoloured and distinctive. (You can think of it
as the name of the speaker in a chat: it's indicating that <em>PuTTY
is saying</em> whatever is written next to it.)

<p>
<b>In Plink</b>: at the point where authentication ends and the main
session begins, we print a new interactive message: ‘Access granted.
Press Return to begin session’. Then we wait for the user to
acknowledge it by pressing Return, which means that even if the server
overwrites the message immediately afterwards, the user will have seen
it already and will know to be suspicious.

<p>
This additional interactive prompt is rather annoying (especially if you had set up one-touch authentication via a passphraseless SSH key or Pageant), so we provide as many methods as possible to avoid it:
<ul>
<li>If you run Plink with the <code>-batch</code> option, it is
assumed that you already know that you're not expecting <em>any</em>
interactive authentication prompts, so you'll already be suspicious of
anything that resembles one. So the new prompt is not given.
<li>If you run Plink with its standard input redirected to anywhere
other than the terminal, then server-side authentication-prompt
spoofing would not gain the server anything in any case, since you
wouldn't be <em>able</em> to enter a response even if you were fooled
by the prompt. So the new prompt is not given.
<li>If you trust your server not to do this in any case, you can run
Plink with the <code>-no-antispoof</code> option, which
unconditionally eliminates the new prompt.
</ul>
In particular, the rule about redirecting Plink's standard input
should cover all cases where Plink is being used as a transport for an
automated protocol such as <code>git</code> or <code>rsync</code>,
which was the original use case for Plink in any case. The new prompt
<em>should</em> only appear if you're using Plink for terminal-based
<em>interactive</em> login, and even there, you have a choice of ways
to suppress it.

<p>
<b>During authentication</b> (in all tools, GUI and console): prompts
and text sent by the server as part of the authentication phase (e.g.
SSH banners, or <code>keyboard-interactive</code> server-generated
login prompts) are prefixed with a vertical-bar symbol
(‘<code>|</code>’) on each line, and their line lengths are limited so
that on a default 80-column terminal the server can't mimic an
unprefixed prompt by word wrapping. This should allow you to
distinguish a legitimate request for your passphrase from a fake one
sent by the server, even if the server sends it <em>during</em>
authentication.

<p>
(This does mean that banners that previously took up the full width of
a terminal, e.g., 79 or 80 characters, will now wrap and look ugly.
This is unavoidable.)

<p>
This vulnerability was found as part of a
<a href="https://hackerone.com/putty_h1c">bug bounty programme</a> run under
the auspices of the EU-FOSSA project.
