<b>summary</b>: Hooks to run external commands (e.g. after forwarding set up)<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>medium:</i> This should be fixed one day.<br>
<p>
We occasionally get asked for the ability to run external commands at
various points in PuTTY's operation. One particularly common request
is for some way to invoke a command after authentication has completed
and port forwarding has been set up, to start an application that's
dependent on the forwarding being in place.

<p>
Possibly an application for <a href="scripting.html">scripting</a>,
although many common cases wouldn't need that level of flexibility.
