<b>summary</b>: Unix Pageant should be able to build without GTK<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>low:</i> We aren&#x27;t sure whether to fix this or not.<br>
<p>Currently, Unix Pageant insists on linking against GTK, so that if
you run it in the context of a GUI login session, it can use GTK to
put up passphrase prompts. (Either when acting as a client and adding
a key, or when acting as a server and decrypting a key that was added
in still-encrypted form.)

<p>There are plenty of things Unix Pageant can still usefully do
without needing to talk to GTK. So it should still be possible to
compile a reduced-functionality version of it when GTK is not detected
at configure time.

<p>Now that PuTTY's build system is based on cmake, this wouldn't be
especially difficult. (In the old <code>mkfiles.pl</code> system it
would probably have been more painful.)

<p>For the case where Pageant is running in client mode, the no-GTK
behaviour would be: if you need to display a passphrase prompt, you
have no available options for that except the GTK prompt, and you
don't have GTK.

<p>When Pageant is in server mode, we <em>could</em> do the same
thing, but that would be a bit unfortunate, because the effect would
be that a user could add their encrypted key as normal, and then find
they had no way at all to decrypt it. A better approach would be to
reject the attempt to <em>add</em> the encrypted key, if Pageant
realises that it would have no available way to present a passphrase
prompt to decrypt it.
