<b>summary</b>: Strange WinSock messages cause failed assertion in tree234.c<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>semi-bug:</i> This might or might not be a bug, depending on your precise definition of what a bug is.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>medium:</i> This should be fixed one day.<br>
<b>present-in</b>: 0.53 0.53b 2002-12-09 2003-01-07<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: 2003-01-10 <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=1604a192fe9f62f9f47369c5267f9c3609ebda47">1604a192fe9f62f9f47369c5267f9c3609ebda47</a> (0.54)<br>
<p>
A few people have reported seeing the following assertion failure:

<pre>Assertion failed!

Program: C:\Program Files\Putty\putty.exe
File: tree234.c
Line: 536

Expression: relation == REL234_LT || relation == REL234_GT</pre>

<p>
Appears to be dependent on use of port forwarding. Also, "It was
working fine until a few days ago", "funnily enough this started
happening in the last couple of weeks", so may be something to do with
a Windows hotfix or update.
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?as_umsgid=auv6q1$ued$03$1%40news.t-online.com">One report</a>
indicates that it happens on WinXP but not Win2000; another report is
against WinME.

<p>
Reports:
<ul>
<li><code>200211231214.AA3343320060@nextgen.net.mt</code>
<li><code>00c801c29c20$5bce79e0$0301a8c0@jefflap3</code>
</ul>

<p>
As far as we can tell this implies that WinSock is sending us unexpected
messages. As of 2002-12-09, diagnostics have been added of the form
"Strange WinSock message: wp=00000000 lp=00000002"; the numbers will
help us to debug the problem. Further info from an original reporter 
(<code>005801c2b80e$b6a3b470$1f69010a@jefflap3</code>):

<blockquote>
I have noticed that the lp=1 correlates to the rule
for port 3000 and lp=2 correlates to the rule for port 110.
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>SGT</b>: Reported as fixed in 2003-01-10. (The diagnostics
confirmed that WinSock was occasionally sending netevent messages
with wParam==0, hence relevant to no socket. If the lParam had
contained an error notification for an error which wasn't
socket-specific, I might have believed they were meaningful and paid
them some attention; but the lParam was actually an ordinary
FD_READ/FD_WRITE sort of thing which makes no sense on a non-socket.
So I've just put in code to ignore such messages, and that seems to
have worked.)
