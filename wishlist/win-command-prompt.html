<b>summary</b>: Ability to backend on to a Windows command interpreter<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>mayhem:</i> Probably impossible<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>low:</i> We aren&#x27;t sure whether to fix this or not.<br>
<p>
Lots of people ask whether PuTTY would be able to act as a front end
for Windows command interpreters (Command Prompt, bash, etc), in
place of the not-very-pleasant standard console window.

<p>
I (SGT) have done some experimental work in this direction, but it
doesn't look promising, since Windows's interface to its console
devices is fundamentally different in nature from Unix's system of
terminals and pseudo-terminals.

<p>
Unix programs communicate with their terminal via a serialised stream
of data in which literal text to be written to the screen is
intermixed with control codes to do operations such as positioning the
cursor, clearing the screen, and setting the colour. This architecture
makes it very natural and simple to put a network connection in
between the terminal application and the software or hardware which is
converting that serialised data stream into a rectangular view of a
terminal window; Unix supports this by providing "pseudo-terminal"
devices, which look and behave just like an ordinary Unix terminal
from the point of view of the applications running in them, but which
pass the data stream to another application which can interpret it
itself. Unix programs such as <code>xterm</code>, and also network
servers such as <code>sshd</code>, all work by using these
pseudo-terminal devices to retrieve the stream of terminal data. In
<code>sshd</code>'s case, the data is then passed on to a remote
network client such as PuTTY, which receives that stream of terminal
data and interprets all the control codes so as to display the literal
text into its window as those codes instruct it.

<p>
By contrast, Windows's console device is much more geared to direct
access via the Windows API: there are API functions to ask Windows to
read or write out the contents of a console's rectangular screen
buffer, to change the colour, and so on. Windows has no analogue of
Unix's pseudo-terminal device: there is no convenient way to create
something that looks like a Windows console to its client application
but passes all requests on to another application which can decide how
to answer them.

<p>
(This is a slight oversimplification. Unix does include one or two
terminal operations which are not serialised into the usual data
stream but are instead performed by direct Unix API calls, such as
resizing the window. However, in such cases Unix is careful to provide
an out-of-band mechanism for applications using pseudo-terminals to
arrange correct handling of the operation.)

<p>
It is just about possible (though extremely fiddly) to construct an
application which instantiates a Windows console as a hidden window,
and uses the same console API used by applications running in the
console to read out its screen buffer and transfer that into the PuTTY
window. This would give a window that had the look and feel of PuTTY
(and, in particular, PuTTY's cut and paste interface), but running a
Windows command prompt inside it. I have an experimental branch of the
PuTTY code base (last touched in 2009) which attempts this.

<p>
However, it's not of production quality and probably never will be.
Many things go subtly wrong when you attempt this sort of hackery, and
handling of errors and exceptional cases is often very hard to get
right. For example, it's extremely hard to arrange that if the PuTTY
managing the invisible console window crashes, all processes using the
console are cleaned up correctly. It's also hard to get GUI processes
started from the invisible console not to be invisible themselves.
Also, important keystrokes like Ctrl-C are difficult to pass through
properly to the underlying console.

<p>
On the other hand, making PuTTY behave like a local terminal window
for <em>Cygwin</em> processes in particular is a much more feasible
piece of work, since Cygwin carefully emulates the Unix-like terminal
model which PuTTY already understands, so all that PuTTY has to do is
to arrange to be able to talk to that emulation. See
<a href="cygwin-terminal-window.html">cygwin-terminal-window</a> for thoughts on this.

<p>
<em>2018 update:</em> Windows (as of Windows 10 build 1809) has grown
an interface called
<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2018/08/02/windows-command-line-introducing-the-windows-pseudo-console-conpty/">ConPTY</a>,
which ought to help with this.
