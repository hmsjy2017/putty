<b>summary</b>: Logging for Pageant<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>medium:</i> This should be fixed one day.<br>
<p>
It would be good if Pageant could provide a log of requests that have
been made of it (who, what, when) - particularly useful if agent
forwarding is in use. Perhaps something in the style of PuTTY's Event
Log? Perhaps a persistent disk log would also be useful.

<p>
If nothing else, this gives you a means of finding out if agent
forwardings have been unexpectedly abused.

<p>
<b>2015-05</b>: downgraded the difficulty. Now that the main Pageant
code is centralised and cross-platform, the work for this is mostly
done; it's now merely a matter of setting up an event log GUI window
(which could probably be shared with PuTTY's own) and deciding whether
we also need a log-to-disk option.
