<b>summary</b>: RSA keys generated by PuTTYgen could be one bit too short<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>semi-bug:</i> This might or might not be a bug, depending on your precise definition of what a bug is.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>low:</i> We aren&#x27;t sure whether to fix this or not.<br>
<b>absent-in</b>: 0.70<br>
<b>present-in</b>: 0.71<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=582284fa6c27dc30484789a803ab968beea2a5a3">582284fa6c27dc30484789a803ab968beea2a5a3</a> (0.72)<br>
<p>
When PuTTYgen is asked to generate an RSA key with a 2<i>n</i>-bit
modulus, it does it by generating two <i>n</i>-bit primes and
multiplying them together. (Adjusted appropriately if the requested
length is odd.)

<p>
Implemented naïvely, this technique could generate either a
(2<i>n</i>−1)-bit modulus or a 2<i>n</i>-bit one, because if each
input prime is between 1/2 and 1 times 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>, then
their product could be anywhere between 1/4 and 1 times
2<sup>2<i>n</i></sup>, and the bottom half of that range gives a key
modulus one bit smaller than the user asked for.

<p>
Cryptographically, this is perfectly harmless (there's no significant
difference in ease of factoring between a 2048- and 2047-bit key). But
people often used to complain, so in 0.63 we introduced a check that
would control the initial few bits of the primes just enough to
guarantee their product was at least 1/2 × 2<sup>2<i>n</i></sup>.

<p>
Just before the 0.71 release, that checking code was rewritten to
improve it in minor ways, and was not quite adequately tested, which
reintroduced the bug where keys can be one bit short. In 0.72, that's
now fixed again.
