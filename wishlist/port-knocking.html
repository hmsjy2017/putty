<b>summary</b>: Port knocking<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>never:</i> We don&#x27;t ever intend to fix this.<br>
<p>
We have been asked several times to implement <a
href="http://www.portknocking.org/">Port Knocking</a>: a mechanism
for making a running service appear to be a connection-refusing
closed port unless the right sequence of "knocks" (attempted
connections to genuinely closed ports) is received before the
connection attempt.

<p>
The PuTTY team is collectively unconvinced that this is a good idea.
For a start, it's not universally usable, because many firewalls
won't let the knocks through. (Obviously the firewall at the server
end is precisely what will need to be specifically listening out for
the knock, but firewalls at the client end or in between are likely
to cause a lot more trouble. And in particular, if you're connecting
through an <em>SSH tunnel</em>, you'll have a hard time sending a
knock.) Also, since the knock is effectively sent in cleartext, it
doesn't buy you a great deal of security - the only real gain is
that your service appears to be a closed port to anyone doing a port
scan, and although that might have advantages it might also cause
administrators to become more relaxed about the <em>real</em>
security of their service. It seems like a lot of effort for very
little gain.

<p>
Much more importantly, though, we don't like the idea of this
mechanism having to be implemented separately in <em>every</em>
network client program - particularly given the hints on the port
knocking website that more inventive forms of knock may be developed
in future, which would of course mean we'd have to keep up with
development. To implement and maintain this in PuTTY and all other
network utilities would be a huge amount of effort.

<p>
If this is to be done at all, it should be done in a largely
client-independent manner. For example:

<ul>
<li>
Write a small command-line application which
performs the port knock, makes the connection, and then gateways the
connection to its standard input and output: a
port-knocking enabled equivalent
of <a
href="http://www.atstake.com/research/tools/network_utilities/"><code>nc</code>(1)</a>.
Then invoke that using the "Local" proxy setting in PuTTY (works on both
Windows and Unix).
<li>
Write a SOCKS server which understands your port knocking, and
performs the appropriate knock before proxying any given connection.
Point PuTTY at it using our existing SOCKS proxy support.
<li>
An even simpler approach: write a script which runs the knock
program, and <em>then</em> launches PuTTY and tells it to connect to
the appropriate host. The <a
href="http://doorman.sourceforge.net/">doorman.sourceforge.net</a>
client, for example, is intended to be used this way.
<li>
(Unix only) Construct a dynamic library which replaces the
<code>connect</code>(2) system call so that it performs the knock
first. Then you can use <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> to apply it to
almost any application.
</ul>

<p>
If anyone really wants to see this feature in PuTTY, they should
probably look into one of the above options.
