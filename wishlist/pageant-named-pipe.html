<p>
Windows Pageant's method of communicating with clients, using
<code>WM_COPYDATA</code> and a piece of shared memory, is absolutely
horrible. It dates from early in Win32's history, before more sensible
IPC systems were widespread.

<p>
It would be good to begin the process of replacing it with a sensible
mechanism based on Windows named pipes, the same IPC mechanism that
connection-sharing instances of PuTTY use to talk to each other.

<p>
Apart from the purely aesthetic 'not being disgusting' sorts of
advantages, this IPC system would be an improvement on the current
Pageant one in several ways:
<ul>
<li><b>Independent of Windows messages</b>: Pageant would no longer be
constrained by the structure of the Windows message loop to respond to
agent requests before it can resume GUI activity. This opens the way
to implement features such as
<a href="pageant-deferred-decrypt.html">pageant-deferred-decrypt</a>.
<li><b>Unbounded</b>: there would no longer be a need to impose a
strict upper limit on the length of a Pageant request or response.
(The current implementation has an arbitrary limit of 8kbyte, and
so breaks ungracefully when you have a large number of keys in
Pageant.)
<li><b>Stateful</b>: it permits Pageant to know which sequences of
requests it receives are part of the same connection from the same
client, which unblocks blue-sky possibilities such as
<a href="pageant-forwarding-path.html">pageant-forwarding-path</a>.
</ul>

<p>
Of course, we would have to continue <em>supporting</em> the old
<code>WM_COPYDATA</code> system in parallel for (at least) a long
time, because an unknown number of third-party clients use it. So any
new features that depend on the new IPC (as discussed above) would
have to be implemented in such a way that <code>WM_COPYDATA</code>
clients would cope somehow.

<p>
Actually setting up the named pipe system itself should be reasonably
easy these days: named pipe IPC is fully implemented (including the
right security setup) for connection sharing, and the Pageant code has
already been restructured to involve a Plug data structure suitable
for passing straight to <code>new_named_pipe_listener()</code> (though
of course we'd also have to endow Windows Pageant with the same kind
of main event loop PuTTY has). The client side shouldn't be any
harder.

<p>
The more interesting question would be how to support both IPC systems
in one program, in the most helpful possible way. One thought I've
been considering runs along the following lines:
<ul>
<li>Divide Windows Pageant into two threads.
<li>The main thread runs both the visible GUI and the named-pipe
listener, and has a main event loop that selects between its Windows
message queue and a set of event objects from <code>winhandl.c</code>,
more or less exactly like PuTTY's event loop.
<li>The secondary thread creates the invisible window that
<code>WM_COPYDATA</code> clients will send their request messages to.
This should (if I've correctly understood how message queues, windows
and threads interact) cause the secondary thread to receive those
agent requests, and the main thread to receive all other GUI activity.
<li>The secondary thread handles each <code>WM_COPYDATA</code> request
by opening a connection to the named pipe, just as if it was a client
in a separate process. It waits for the response before replying to
the message.
</ul>
Doing it this way might well manage to get round some of the
limitations of the Windows-message IPC system: in particular, it might
still be possible to provide deferred key decryption to
<code>WM_COPYDATA</code> clients, because the Windows message activity
required to present the passphrase prompt would all happen in one
thread, while the other thread was still blocked waiting to reply to
the <code>WM_COPYDATA</code>.

<p>
But if that turns out not to work (e.g. perhaps there's a time limit
on how long you can delay responding to a <code>SendMessage</code>, or
perhaps I've misunderstood how multiple threads' message queues
interact), then the fallback position would be to simply not present
any key to <code>WM_COPYDATA</code> clients that isn't immediately
usable without user interaction.

<hr>

<p>
2020-01: implemented, including moving <code>WM_COPYDATA</code>
servicing into a subthread.
