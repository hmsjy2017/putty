<b>summary</b>: More potential malicious code execution via indirect DLL hijacking<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>vulnerability:</i> This is a security vulnerability.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>high:</i> This should be fixed in the next release.<br>
<b>present-in</b>: 0.69<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: 0.70<br>
<p>
On some versions of Windows, all versions of the PuTTY tools up to and
including 0.69 can end up loading a DLL from the local directory which
contains the PuTTY executables.

<p>
We believed we had fixed this class of problem in 0.68 (see
<a href="vuln-indirect-dll-hijack.html">vuln-indirect-dll-hijack</a>), and when that turned out not to
be true, we believed we'd fixed all the remaining instances in 0.69
(<a href="vuln-indirect-dll-hijack-2.html">vuln-indirect-dll-hijack-2</a>). However, it turned out that
even in 0.69 we <em>still</em> hadn't caught all cases of it.

<p>
We know of one special DLL name to which PuTTY 0.69 was still vulnerable:
<ul>
<li><code>CRYPTBASE.DLL</code>
</ul>

<p>
We believed we had finished fixing these problems in 0.69 because all
the remaining DLLs that PuTTY's makefile <em>explicitly</em> told the
linker to refer to at load time were on the default 'known DLLs' list,
which seems to accord those DLL names special load-time treatment
which prevents this kind of hijacking attack. However, the remaining
problem involved a system function <em>not</em> explicitly used in
PuTTY's code – the reference to it apparently came from an
internal module in Visual Studio's standard library. Updating our
build environment to use Visual Studio 2015 update 3 instead of the
original 2015 RTM build made the rogue function reference go away and
appears to have closed this hole.

<p>
(The API name of the system function in question is <a
href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa387694(v=vs.85).aspx"><code>RtlGenRandom()</code></a>,
but physically, it's imported from <code>ADVAPI32.DLL</code> by the
name <code>SystemFunction036</code>.)

<p>
As described in the previous related bug entries, the most likely way
in which this vulnerability could be used in an attack is via a web
browser's download directory – an attacker contrives to deliver
a malicious DLL into your download directory under one of the special
names that an application is vulnerable to, and when you later
download and run PuTTY, it loads that DLL from alongside itself and is
taken over. Whereas if PuTTY is installed on the system via the MSI
installer, then there is no issue, because the installer will put the
executable files in a dedicated directory, and an attacker with enough
file access permissions to drop malicious DLLs into that directory
would probably be able to overwrite the executable files themselves in
any case.

<p>
Thanks to Walter Thyselius for reporting this additional vulnerability
to us.
