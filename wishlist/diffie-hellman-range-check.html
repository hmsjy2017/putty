<b>summary</b>: Missing range check in Diffie-Hellman key exchange<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>bug:</i> This is clearly an actual problem we want fixed.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>high:</i> This should be fixed in the next release.<br>
<b>present-in</b>: 0.63<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: 0.64 <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=174476813f0ed94337aecc3e2d13a202a1dc2fa8">174476813f0ed94337aecc3e2d13a202a1dc2fa8</a><br>
<p>
PuTTY 0.63 and earlier versions implement Diffie-Hellman key exchange
without checking that the value sent by the server is within the range
[1,p-1]. This range check is required by section 8 of RFC 4253.

<p>
PuTTY 0.64 does fix this. In fact, it enforces the slightly smaller
range [2,p-2], since values 1 and p-1 are also worthless for secure
Diffie-Hellman.

<p>
Thanks to Matta Security for reporting this bug.

<p>
Matta considers this to be a security vulnerability, on the grounds
that a Diffie-Hellman value of zero (for example) sent by the server,
if not rejected by the client, would constitute a weak key and permit
even a passive eavesdropper to read the session traffic. Matta has
assigned this issue the id "MATTA-2015-002"; we were given
<a href="https://www.trustmatta.com/advisories/MATTA-2015-002.txt">this URL</a>
for the forthcoming advisory, but as of the time of writing it has not
yet appeared.

<p>
With respect to Matta, we do not classify this as a vulnerability: a
server sending a value of zero <em>on purpose</em> could just as
easily expose the session traffic by other methods anyway (e.g. simply
sending a copy of the traffic to whoever it wanted to), and given the
range of values from which Diffie-Hellman keys are selected, a server
sending the value zero <em>by accident</em> would happen with
probability far, far lower than a spontaneous collision in a secure
hash function, so if spontaneous hash collision is not considered a
vulnerability then neither should this be.
