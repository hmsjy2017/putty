<b>summary</b>: Ability to run Pageant as a Windows Service in NT/2000/etc<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>never:</i> We don&#x27;t ever intend to fix this.<br>
<p>
People occasionally ask if it's possible to enable running Pageant as
a Windows Service.

<p>
It's not. This is for two reasons:

<ul>
 <li>Pageant's IPC is pretty ad-hoc, and is done partly through
     window messages. Hence Pageant needs to have a window open at
     all times, so it can't run as a persistent service through
     multiple people's sessions.

 <li>Pageant is designed to be used by a single user of a machine
     (and it contains security code to enforce this). If it ran as a
     service, it would have to somehow segregate requests from
     multiple users, maintain lots of separate key databases, do its
     own internal access control to work out which requests were
     allowed to access what, and generally things would get a lot
     more complicated. It's never seemed worth going to this effort.
</ul>

<p>
In any case, I've never been sure of the usefulness of running a
long-term SSH agent to supply keys to automated scripts. That
doesn't seem much more secure than just leaving the unencrypted key
on disk - it might protect you against physical-access attacks in
which the attacker shuts the machine down, steals the hard disk, and
then can't recover the unencrypted key, but against the much more
likely network attack in which the attacker gains access to the
still-running machine it's no help because it's almost as easy to
read keys out of the agent's memory as it is to read them off disk.

<p>
A better solution for automated scripts is to create a dedicated SSH key
for each automated task, and <em>restrict</em> the capabilities of that key
on the server side. Then just store the private key unencrypted
(readable by you only, of course) on the client. That way, if an
attacker manages to gain access to the key file, then they don't
gain unrestricted access to the account on the server; instead they
only gain the specific ability to tamper with the progress of that
particular automated script. Also I think it makes the scripts more
reliable, because they only depend on disk files, and they're not
dependent on the presence of a persistent process that might have
(for example) unexpectedly segfaulted or been accidentally killed a
day ago.
