<b>summary</b>: An option to accept all SSH host keys<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>never:</i> We don&#x27;t ever intend to fix this.<br>
<p>
An option to automatically accept all SSH host keys. For some reason
lots of people seem to think this would be a really useful feature.
I'm sure it would be very convenient, but at the expense of security!
The whole point of host keys is that they're the <em>only</em>
guarantee you have that your connection hasn't been hijacked by an
active attacker between you and the server, and that your data isn't
being decrypted by the attacker and re-encrypted. If you want to
schedule an automated batch job to use PSCP or Plink, and the
interactive host key prompt is making this difficult, <em>add the
correct host key to the registry ahead of time</em>. (<b>Update,
2014-09-09</b>: or if the Registry isn't available, you can use the
new <code>-hostkey</code> option to specify the right key or
fingerprint on the command line.) That way you still get the
convenience, but without losing the security. We will <em>not</em>
accept a command line option to turn off host key checking, no matter
how many people have already done the work and send us polished
production-quality patches.

<p>
If you have host keys available in the common `known_hosts' format, we
have
<a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=blob;f=contrib/kh2reg.py;hb=HEAD">a script</a>
to convert them to a Windows .REG file which can be installed ahead of
time by double-clicking.
