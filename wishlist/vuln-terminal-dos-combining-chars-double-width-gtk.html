<b>summary</b>: DoS by terminal output involving combining characters, double-width text, an odd number of terminal columns, and GTK<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>vulnerability:</i> This is a security vulnerability.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>high:</i> This should be fixed in the next release.<br>
<b>absent-in</b>: 0.57<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=daf91ef8ae9780bb1dfb534afa79e4babb89ba26">daf91ef8ae9780bb1dfb534afa79e4babb89ba26</a> 0.71<br>
<p>
Up to and including version 0.70, the GTK front end to PuTTY's
terminal emulator would fail an assertion in a corner case:
<ul>
<li>if the terminal width is an odd number of columns
<li>and if you use an escape sequence such as <code>ESC # 6</code> to
make the whole line double-width, leaving an unusable odd character
cell at the end of the line
<li>and if you position the cursor on that final odd cell and try to
display a Unicode character with at least one combining character.
</ul>

<p>
All the conditions for this failure can be triggered by remote
terminal output. (Remote-controlled resizing of the terminal window
can be turned off in the Features config panel, but it's on by
default.) So, if a malicious process is able to write escape sequences
to your terminal, then they can terminate your entire PuTTY session
uncleanly, making it impossible for you to even recover any important
information from your terminal scrollback.

<p>
As of 0.71, this assertion failure is fixed. PuTTY will cleanly handle
this case by not trying to display anything that confuses it.

<p>
This vulnerability was found by Brian Carpenter, as part of a
<a href="https://hackerone.com/putty_h1c">bug bounty programme</a> run under
the auspices of the EU-FOSSA project.
