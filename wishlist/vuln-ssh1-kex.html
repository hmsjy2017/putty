<p>
All versions of the PuTTY suite prior to 0.55 have a memory
corruption bug in SSH-1 key exchange, which might lead to a security
vulnerability.

<p>
The bug lies in the <code>rsaencrypt()</code> function, which
performs RSA encryption with
<a href="ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/ascii/pkcs-1.asc">PKCS#1 v1.5</a>
padding, as used in the SSH-1 key exchange. This function assumes
that the data to be encrypted is smaller than the modulus of the
public key. If this is not the case, the <code>memmove()</code>
operation at the start of the function will overwrite memory before
the input buffer.

<p>
A malicious server can trigger this bug by sending an unexpectedly
small public key modulus. However, it is not clear that the server
can exploit this bug to take <em>control</em> of the client, since
the data written beyond the buffer is part of the cleartext invented
by the client, not part of the key modulus sent by the server. I
(SGT) doubt that a server can do much more than cause the client to
crash by exploiting this bug.

<p>
Nonetheless, that's more than a server <em>should</em> be able to
do, and it is just possible that there is a more damaging exploit in
spite of appearances, so this is still a serious bug that needs
fixing. PuTTY release 0.55 fixes it by having
<code>rsaencrypt()</code> explicitly check that the public key is
long enough to allow the encryption of the supplied data.

<p>
Although PuTTY verifies the server's host key against its Registry
cache before performing the vulnerable encryption operation, this
does not protect you from a spoofed server or man-in-the-middle
attack. SSH-1 involves two public keys: a server key (changed every
hour, for forward security) and a host key (never changed, for
server authentication). Some data is encrypted using both keys, and
then the server proves its identity by decrypting it. So a MITM can
send a maliciously shortened <em>server</em> key and the correct
<em>host</em> key; the fact that it does not have the private half
of the host key will not matter, since by the time it is challenged
to prove its identity by decrypting the doubly encrypted data, the
short server key will have already triggered the bug and the damage
will be done.

<p>
This bug was discovered by
<a href="http://www.coresecurity.com/">Core Security Technologies</a>,
and documented in their advisory
<a href="http://www.coresecurity.com/common/showdoc.php?idx=417&idxseccion=10">CORE-2004-0705</a>.
It is also mentioned in an advisory by Secunia, numbered
