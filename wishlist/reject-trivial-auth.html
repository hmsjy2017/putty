<b>summary</b>: Option to reject trivial authentication in SSH<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>high:</i> This should be fixed in the next release.<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=5f5c710cf3704737e24ffceb2c918e412a2a674f">5f5c710cf3704737e24ffceb2c918e412a2a674f</a> <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=1dc5659aa62848f0aeb5de7bd3839fecc7debefa">1dc5659aa62848f0aeb5de7bd3839fecc7debefa</a> (0.76)<br>
<p>From version 0.76, PuTTY will include an option to abandon an SSH
connection if the SSH server ends the user authentication phase of the
protocol without requiring any substantive input from PuTTY.

<p>This option is available in the GUI in the Connection > SSH >
Auth config panel ("Disconnect if authentication succeeds trivially"),
or on the command line as <code>-no-trivial-auth</code>.

<p>This is intended as a second line of defence against the same class
of problem we describe in <a href="vuln-auth-prompt-spoofing.html">vuln-auth-prompt-spoofing</a>, and
addressed in 0.71 via a system of trust sigils (in GUI PuTTY) and
post-authentication confirmation prompts (in command-line Plink).

<p>The general class of attack is: you expect PuTTY itself to request
some kind of input from you during authentication (such as prompting
you for your key passphrase), but the server is either compromised or
malicious, and instead, it sends a
<code>SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS</code> response immediately, and then
the <em>server</em> tries to request the same input, by arranging for
you to receive a similar-looking prompt during the main session.

<p>In this way, for example, you might be tricked into sending your
private key's decryption passphrase <em>to the server</em>, when it
never should have left your own machine.

<p>This class of issue was reported to us in 2019, and in 0.71, we
fixed it by the trust sigil system. Anything the server sends to try
to trick you into thinking that authentication is still ongoing will
lack the PuTTY icon to its left.

<p>However, it was suggested to us that it makes life easier for the
user not to have to spot the presence or absence of that small sigil.
If you're <em>expecting</em> the server not to let you in without
actually presenting some authentication (be it a password, a
public-key signature, a one-time token or whatever), then you can now
tell PuTTY that, and if the server should be taken over so as to
attempt this kind of spoofing, PuTTY will disconnect before even
presenting the spoof prompt.

<p>(But note that it's not a perfect defence in all cases. If an SSH
server is configured to require two forms of authentication in
sequence, then it could terminate early after the first of them, and
this option wouldn't know anything was wrong!)

<p>This is a new <strong>option</strong>, not enabled by default.
That's because it is perfectly legal for an SSH server to let you in
without any authentication! Some servers do it entirely on purpose,
typically because they are SSH wrappers around some other service that
presents its own login prompt not integrated with the SSH layer.

<p><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-36367">CVE-2021-36367</a> refers to this new option as a fix for a
vulnerability, and describes the vulnerability as "PuTTY through 0.75
proceeds with establishing an SSH session even if it has never sent a
substantive authentication response". With respect to the author of
that text, we consider that to be misleading. It is perfectly legal
for the server to waive authentication, and actually useful in some
legitimate use cases; it is perfectly legal for PuTTY to proceed with
the connection regardless; and the trust sigil system introduced in
0.71 <em>already</em> defends against every spoofing attack we know of
that a server could attempt by doing this unexpectedly. This new
option is a UI improvement, but not in and of itself a vital
vulnerability fix.
