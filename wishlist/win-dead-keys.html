<b>summary</b>: Trouble with dead keys on Windows<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>semi-bug:</i> This might or might not be a bug, depending on your precise definition of what a bug is.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>taxing:</i> Needs external things we don&#x27;t have (standards, users etc)<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>medium:</i> This should be fixed one day.<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: 2004-03-27 <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=4736781f42e99168a2fc792b96141d08ee5d6497">4736781f42e99168a2fc792b96141d08ee5d6497</a> (0.55)<br>
<p>
When using a keyboard layout that uses dead keys (such as German, or
US International) on Win2K or XP, entering a non-composing sequence
(such as a pair of circumflexes), such that the second keypress
resulted in two characters, gave the wrong result (the second
character was wrong).

<p>
Changing the storage behind the <code>lpChar</code> argument of 
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/UserInput/KeyboardInput/KeyboardInputReference/KeyboardInputFunctions/ToAsciiEx.asp"><code>ToAsciiEx</code></a>
from <code>WORD[]</code> to <code>BYTE[]</code>, and using a pointer
cast, makes it work properly on 2K/XP. (Done as of 2004-03-25.) The
documentation isn't clear what type the storage behind the pointer
should be, but Googling indicates that this usage is not uncommon.

<p>
<em>However,</em> this breaks the same situation in (French and German) Win98SE,
which was working OK before with the <code>WORD[]</code> array. (But
fixes it for French Win2K.) The storage of the array is conditionalised
on Windows version as of 2004-03-27. *crosses fingers*

<p>
This area is rich in history. For example:
<ul>
<li>We originally switched from <code>ToAscii</code> to
<code>ToAsciiEx</code> to fix a problem a Lithuanian user was having
with top bits being stripped.
<br>ref: 20001222172132.A17154@kibiras.kaunas.alna.lt
<li>We then had a <a href="mapvirtualkeyex.html">complaint</a> from a
Korean user that <code>ToAsciiEx</code> didn't work on Korean Win98
(but was OK on WinMe and 2000), whereas <code>ToAscii</code> was fine.
We didn't do anything about this because it seemed just too horrible.
<br>ref: 3B67475D.64790726@kias.re.kr
<li>We've also had a <a href="keyboard-problems.html">complaint</a>
from a Danish user that they get the first key in a dead key sequence
<em>and</em> the composed character.
<br>ref: 000701c09c57$a2ce70e0$0e00a8c0@neland.dk
<li>We've had a report that fiddling with the <code>keys</code> array
<em>before</em> passing it to <code>ToAsciiEx</code> makes a
difference, which could be consistent with a confusion like that
described above.
<br>ref: E14wR3x-0000t8-00@ixion.tartarus.org
</ul>

<p>
I've got a horrible suspicion that it's not as simple as a Win9x/NT
split; this function appears to be an interface to the keyboard
driver, and MS's specification of that interface on their website looks
unclear to me, so I suspect that whether it's an array of bytes or
words is dependent on the keyboard driver in question.

<p>
We could in principle try to detect it by initialising the array with
unlikely values and seeing what changes. Bleurgh.

<p>
This may be the root of some other keyboard problems people have been
having, too, if we're lucky. If our hacking in this area makes a
difference to you (positive <em>or</em> negative), please let us know.
