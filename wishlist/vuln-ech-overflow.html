<p>Versions of PuTTY and pterm between 0.54 and 0.65 inclusive have a
potentially memory-corrupting integer overflow in the handling of the
ECH (erase characters) control sequence in the terminal emulator.

<p>To exploit a vulnerability in the terminal emulator, an attacker
must be able to insert a carefully crafted escape sequence into the
terminal stream. For a PuTTY SSH session, this must be before
encryption, so the attacker likely needs access to the server you're
connecting to. For instance, an attacker on a multi-user machine that
you connect to could trick you into running <tt>cat</tt> on a file
they control containing a malicious escape sequence. (Unix
<tt>write(1)</tt> is not a vector for this, if implemented correctly.)

<p>Only PuTTY, PuTTYtel, and pterm are affected; other PuTTY tools
do not include the terminal emulator, so cannot be exploited this way.

<p>The purpose of ECH is to erase multiple characters within a single
line.  To this end, it includes a numeric parameter to specify the
number of characters to be erased.  PuTTY accumulates this one digit
at a time in an integer variable.  As part of the processing of ECH,
the <code>check_boundary</code> function checks whether the start or
end of the erased range falls in the middle of a double-width
character (such as a kanji ideograph) so that it can ensure that the
whole character is erased.  Each character cell in the live terminal
is held as a structure containing among other things the character
code and a word of attributes.  A double-width character is recorded
by having a special value called <code>UCSWIDE</code> as the character
code in the second cell, and when <code>check_boundary</code> detects
that value, it resets the character code of both cells to a fixed
value and copies the attributes from the left one to the right one.

<p>The vulnerability arises because PuTTY uses signed integer
variables to hold the number of characters to be erased and doesn't
adequately check for overflow.  This means that by passing a very
large parameter to ECH, an attacker could cause
<code>check_boundary</code> to inspect memory outside the terminal
buffer.  Were it to find <code>UCSWIDE</code> there, it would corrupt
some nearby memory.  This might be exploitable if the attacker could
arrange for <code>UCSWIDE</code> to be in memory somewhere near a
sensitive data structure.

<p>This bug was found with the help of
<a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/">American Fuzzy Lop</a>
and has been assigned CVE ID <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5309">CVE-2015-5309</a>.
