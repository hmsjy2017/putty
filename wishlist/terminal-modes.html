<b>summary</b>: Implement sending of full terminal modes in SSH<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>medium:</i> This should be fixed one day.<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: r5653 <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=fb581ac62541bfe09ebbc1de07ef678998b9a539">fb581ac62541bfe09ebbc1de07ef678998b9a539</a> 2005-04-22 (0.59)<br>
<p>
SSH (both SSH-1 and SSH-2) allows the client to specify the mode it wants
server-side pseudo-terminals to be opened in. PuTTY does not currently
specify any such information for either protocol apart from
<a href="ssh-termspeed.html">terminal speed</a>.

<p>
I've always thought it would be nice to be able to configure this
sort of thing locally, so that (for example) users connecting to the
<a href="http://www.mono.org">mono.org</a>
BBS could stop a single press of Ctrl-\ from sending a SIGQUIT and
unexpectedly terminating their session.

<p>
Also, various servers do not have sane defaults for various terminal
modes. (Neither SSH nor POSIX define any defaults; they leave them
up to the implementation, so such servers are technically within their
rights, although I (JTN) consider them buggy nonetheless.)
Therefore PuTTY should probably send suitable values for certain modes
by default, and in any case allow users to tweak them. (Often
<tt>stty</tt> on the server can be used as a workaround, but some
servers may not have this ability.)

<p>
Recently it was suggested to me that if the user has configured
non-`auto' settings for local echo and/or local line editing, then
perhaps PuTTY should deliberately send terminal modes which
compensate for this on the server side? For example, if the user
turns line editing off at the client end, we could send ICANON so
that it's turned on at the server end; or conversely if the user
enables local line editing we could send ~ICANON. It isn't remotely
clear to me that this would be the right thing in all circumstances,
though, so perhaps it would be better to leave it as a
user-configurable option.

<p>
A complete UI for terminal modes would be a noticeable amount of work.

<p>
Configurable options in this area might also be directly usable by
the pty back end in pterm.

<p>
Possibly also Telnet to some extent, since we can send
WILL ECHO / WONT ECHO to announce an intention to do any echoing
locally, and the server is expected to stop doing its own echoing if
it thinks we're doing it ourselves. Perhaps that's better handled
by separate UI, though.

<p>
<em>Update, 2005-04-21:</em> this is basically done. I haven't
implemented any cleverness with echo or line editing (although doing
so should now be a minimal amount of work), and it's SSH-only; nothing
for pterm, or Telnet/Rlogin.
