<b>summary</b>: Port to Mac OS X<br>

<p>
There is a port of PuTTY and pterm to Mac OS X in progress, by means
of compiling the GTK front end against the OS X Quartz version of GTK
3.

<p>
Its state, as of 2016-03-25, is that it's just about usable in a
development context (SGT can just about use the pterm app in place of
OS X's standard Terminal.app) but has far too many bugs and missing
features to call a finished product yet. So for the moment you can
build it from source if you check out the PuTTY repository, but it's
not distributed in binary form.

<p>
(In 2005 there was an attempt to write a <em>native</em> OS X port,
directly using the Cocoa API, but that ran into problems and was never
finished. The GTK version will look less perfectly Mac-native, but has
a greater chance of getting somewhere, and also the ongoing
maintenance advantage that it can automatically inherit bug fixes and
features with the ordinary Unix GTK code.)

There's a large comment at the top containing the list of things that still need to be done, and another comment explaining how to build it.
