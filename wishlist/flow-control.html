<b>summary</b>: Be cleverer with SSH-2 flow control to improve bulk throughput<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>semi-bug:</i> This might or might not be a bug, depending on your precise definition of what a bug is.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>

<b>fixed-in</b>: 2007-09-25 r7735 <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=22f9618deb4f7ad93e1204f669900d84b45f30c8">22f9618deb4f7ad93e1204f669900d84b45f30c8</a> (0.61)<br>
<p>
(This wish applies to SSH-2; SSH-1 doesn't provide flow control above
TCP's.)

<p>As Peter Gutmann has
<a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/app_sec.pdf">observed</a>,
naive implementations of the SSH-2 sliding window protocol place an arbitrary
limit on the throughput of each channel, limiting it to the product of the
window size and the round-trip time (the so-called "SSH-2 handbrake").
PuTTY is one such naive implementation (it uses a fixed channel window size
of 16k).

<p>There are various things that could be done to work around this.  In an
ideal world, PuTTY would measure the bandwidth-delay product of the link it's
running over and use that to set the window so as to fully use the available
bandwidth without completely breaking flow control.  A rather simpler approach
is possible where a connection only has (and only ever will have) one channel
running over it, since in that case PuTTY can open the window fully and leave
flow control to TCP.  This is covered by
<a href="flow-control-filexfer.html">flow-control-filexfer</a>.

<p>
Of course, things become more complicated if multiple channels were to be used
(e.g., port-forwarding of bulk transfers, or some of the wilder excesses of
<a href="ssh2-generality.html">SSH-2 generality</a>).

<p>As of 2007-09-25, PuTTY has much improved window handling.  From the
commit message:

<blockquote>
<p>The basic idea is that when the connection isn't being limited by our ability
to process data, we want to ensure that the window size <em>as seen by the server</em>
never drops to zero.  Measuring the server's view of the window size is done
by arranging for it to acknowledge every SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_WINDOW_ADJUST, or 
rather an SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST
[<a href="https://tartarus.org/~simon/putty-snapshots/htmldoc/AppendixF.html#sshnames-channel">winadj@putty.projects.tartarus.org</a>]
sent just before it.  That way we can tell
when it its outgoing data stream it recieved the window adjustment, and
thus how small the server's view of the window got.

<p>At present, we only ever increase the window size.  In theory, we could
arrange to reduce it again if the server's view of it seemed to be persistently
too large, but my experiments suggest that getting this right will be tricky.
</blockquote>

<p>
Knock-on effects of this change:
<ul>
<li>The new channel requests emitted by PuTTY as part of this change
can cause a lot of noise in the logs of the OpenSSH server -- 
"<tt>sshd[6386]: session_input_channel_req: no session 1 req
winadj@putty.projects.tartarus.org</tt>". This should be mitigated as of
<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1395">OpenSSH 5.1</a>.
</li>
<li>The frequent new channel requests exposed a bug in the
<a href="http://matt.ucc.asn.au/dropbear/dropbear.html">Dropbear</a>
SSH server, leading to PuTTY terminating sessions with a "Received
SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_FAILURE for nonexistent channel" message. This bug
has been fixed in new versions of Dropbear (probably
<a href="http://lists.ucc.gu.uwa.edu.au/pipermail/dropbear/2008q4/000831.html">0.52</a>
onwards).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Another approach (not taken): the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center
<a href="http://www.psc.edu/networking/hpn-ssh/">suggest</a>
that basing the SSH window size on the TCP window size from the
underlying OS can help in some circumstances.  This would only
be valid where the SSH and TCP connections are coterminous, with no
tunnelling taking place.

<p>
If this is done, some higher-level protocols could probably benefit
from similar adaptation -- notably SFTP, which since it was
<a href="sftp-slow.html">sped up</a> has also used a 16k "window size"
of its own for bulk transfers. We've had improvement reported from
tweaking this and the SSH-2 channel window size on a 100Mbit network
(ref <tt>41A6366F.9030909@enriva.com</tt>).
