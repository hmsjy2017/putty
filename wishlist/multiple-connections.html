<b>summary</b>: Managing multiple connections in one PuTTY (eg. tabbed windows, MDI)<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>depends</b>: <a href="remove-statics.html">remove-statics</a><br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>low:</i> We aren&#x27;t sure whether to fix this or not.<br>
<p>
A lot of people seem to want a single PuTTY to be able to manage
multiple connections. The
<a href="http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/putty-tabs/">most popular</a>
UI is per-session tabs on the window, like Firefox or konsole.
Other options include selection with Alt-F1, Alt-F2 etc (like the
Linux console) or an an MDI-style application, with one large main
window containing several session windows.

<p>
For a start, this involves arranging to be able to run more than one
connection within the same PuTTY process. The cross-platform parts
of this work are long since done (see
<a href="remove-statics.html">remove-statics</a>), but the Windows
front end still uses a great many static variables within itself. So
to even consider doing this work would mean a significant amount of
restructuring of the Windows code.

<p>
In addition I'd want a strong guarantee of reliability (if one
session crashes, can it avoid taking the other nine down?). Also I'd
want to be able to configure PuTTY to be just the way it is now,
because not everybody likes the idea of all their sessions being
bound together in a single window; and finally I'd want to be
convinced that the code size increase wouldn't be excessive. This is
close to having priority "never", in fact, unless someone can
convince me it's really worth its while.

<p>
Really, the approach we'd prefer is a separate application that can
swallow instances of PuTTY and provide the tabbing interface. That
way, you're not necessarily restricted to just grouping PuTTY
instances together; you could in principle bundle a PuTTY instance with
a Notepad and a Firefox, say. (This is another way of saying that
the deficiency isn't specific to PuTTY, but is a lack of flexibility
in the policies of most window managers.)

<p>
There are now several third-party implementations of this concept on
our <a href="../links.html">Links page</a>.

<p>
A related suggestion is that separate PuTTY windows could know about
each other, and a key combination such as Ctrl-Tab could switch
between just PuTTY windows. A (scary) patch implementing this was
once to be found
<a href="http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA024651/#PuTTYctrltab_top">here</a>
(web page in Japanese).
