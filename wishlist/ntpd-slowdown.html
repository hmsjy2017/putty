<b>summary</b>: PuTTY causes ntpd to lose time<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>semi-bug:</i> This might or might not be a bug, depending on your precise definition of what a bug is.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>taxing:</i> Needs external things we don&#x27;t have (standards, users etc)<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>medium:</i> This should be fixed one day.<br>
<b>present-in</b>: 0.53b<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: 2004-03-18 <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=c4bfa9b7b77f719a61de6049c9c18d80c9685c9b">c4bfa9b7b77f719a61de6049c9c18d80c9685c9b</a> (0.55)<br>
<p>
It's been reported that running an SSH-2 session through PuTTY causes ntpd
to lose time in 10ms steps, as if 100Hz interrupts are being lost.  The
same problem doesn't affect Telnet connections, though.  Ref
<C5EA7C1F01A7D311A44700508B95196C0730D8AB@004-h00028.wugo.intranet.wegener.nl>
<i>et seq.</i>, which mentions the platform as

<blockquote>
PC DELL Latitude 610 with w2k pro Dutch with SP3 on AC Power.
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I can tell, <code>noise_ultralight()</code> and
<code>noise_regular()</code> are called even during a Telnet
session (they're stubs in PuTTYtel, but in PuTTY they go out
and hunt for noise even if no-one's ever going to consume it).
<code>noise_get_heavy()</code> is only called at the start of an SSH
session, so it shouldn't cause continuing problems, especially not ones
that go away when the session ends.

<p>I think this narrows us down to <code>noise_get_light()</code>,
which is called every time the random pool is used, which
looks like being most packets in an SSH session, but never
in a Telnet session.  <code>noise_get_light()</code> calls
<code>GetSystemTime()</code>, <code>GetSystemTimeAdjustment()</code>
and <code>GetSystemPowerStatus()</code>.

<p>By use of diagnostic builds we've narrowed the problem down to use
of <code>GetSystemPowerStatus()</code>, which is likely to be calling
the APM BIOS, which ISTR has to be done with interrupts disabled.

<p><em>Update, 2004-03-18</em>: the <code>GetSystemPowerStatus()</code>
call has been removed in an attempt to fix
<a href="hard-hangs.html">hard-hangs</a>. With luck, that should
make this problem go away too.
