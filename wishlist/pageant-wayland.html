<b>summary</b>: Unix Pageant should support GUI session lifetime on Wayland<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>low:</i> We aren&#x27;t sure whether to fix this or not.<br>
<p>Unix Pageant has a variety of different options to control the
lifetime of the Pageant process. One of them is <code>-X</code>, aka
<code>LIFE_X11</code> in the source code, which causes Pageant to
connect to your X server as a client, so that when you log out of your
GUI session and the X server terminates all the client connections,
Pageant will take that as the signal to shut down.

<p>If your GUI session is not based on X11, this can't work, of
course. In particular, we have no analogous mechanism for detecting
the end of a GUI login session hosted on pure Wayland.

<p>I don't know enough about Wayland to know the best way to fix that.
Pageant's X11 lifetime support works by using the from-scratch X
authorisation and setup code that PuTTY uses for X forwarding; for
Wayland, we'd either have to write some fresh code to speak the
Wayland protocol, or else link against at least the lowest-level
Wayland client library available.

<p>For extra credit, it would be even better to autodetect which GUI
technology was available, so that users didn't have to guess the right
one in their startup scripts. I don't know how to do that either.
