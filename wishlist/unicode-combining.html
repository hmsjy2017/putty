<b>summary</b>: Support Unicode combining characters<br>

<p>
Unicode contains a number of combining characters (typically
diacritics) which can in principle be combined with _any_ character
appearing before them. For example, you can display CE 9B (U+039B
GREEK CAPITAL LETTER LAMBDA) followed by CC 8A (U+030A COMBINING
RING ABOVE) and get a lambda with a ring above it, as used in a
well-known 
<a href="http://www.stargate-sg1.com/">sci-fi TV series logo</a>.

<p>
PuTTY in UTF-8 mode currently does not support these combining
characters at all. It should.

<p>
At a minimum, it should support the use of combining characters to
create composite characters that actually exist as their own code
points in Unicode. Hence, displaying U+030A when the cursor is just
to the right of a capital A should yield U+00C5 (LATIN CAPITAL
LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE).

<p>
Ideally - and this is where it gets hard - PuTTY should support an
arbitrary sequence of diacritics in any character cell, so that the
above logo can be displayed in full and copied and pasted sensibly.
So rather than having exactly one Unicode code point per character
cell, we would need to make the terminal data structures flexible so
that more than one code point could be stored in a single char cell.
That sequence of code points would be transmitted to the Windows
text display function as a single string, causing the display of the
correct composition of glyphs; and anyone copying and pasting that
character cell would get the same sequence of code points too.
Overwriting that cell would, of course, take out the whole lot in
one go.

<p>
Experimentation with xterm in UTF-8 mode suggests that if the
resulting character does have a Unicode representation then it
should be used in cut-and-paste: hence sending A (U+0041) followed
by U+030A should yield a character cell which pastes back as U+00C5.
More formally, I think what's required is for the sequence of code
points occupying a character cell to be maintained in Normalisation
Form C (see
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr15/">UAX #15</a>).

<p>
Glenn Maynard suggests that all this has a practical application:
<blockquote>
Somewhat more usefully, full combining support is needed for Korean.
As I understand it, while there are a lot of precomposed Korean characters
available, they don't *all* exist, so real Korean support needs real
combining support.
</blockquote>

<p>
<em>Update, 2004-10-15:</em> PuTTY now has the ability to store an
arbitrary number of code points per character cell. Cut and paste is
implemented correctly, and display is by simple overlaying.
Normalisation is not yet implemented; see
<a href="unicode-normalisation.html">unicode-normalisation</a>.
