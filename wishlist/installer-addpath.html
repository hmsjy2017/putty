<b>summary</b>: Add path to PuTTY programs to PATH in Windows installer<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>low:</i> We aren&#x27;t sure whether to fix this or not.<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: 0.67 <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=5c5879b99d2a0785095a384f48a2d934e1b2d4c5">5c5879b99d2a0785095a384f48a2d934e1b2d4c5</a><br>
<p>
We occasionally get asked to add an option in the Windows installer
package to add the command-line programs such as PSCP and Plink to the
system <tt>PATH</tt>.

<ul>

<li>
On Win95/98/Me, this probably involves automatically modifying
<tt>AUTOEXEC.BAT</tt>, which is probably not something we want to go
anywhere near.

<li>
On NT-class systems, it's a bit better, as we can do this by
modifying a Registry entry, and even prod running programs to pick
it up. However, it's probably not possible to do this in a
reversible way, so it would probably stay on the <tt>PATH</tt>
even after uninstallation, which is bad. (We haven't actually
<em>tried</em> this yet.)

</ul>

<p>
One suggested solution is to use
<a href="http://marcobari.altervista.org/add_path.html">add_path</a>.

<p>
<em>Update, 2016-03:</em> the MSI-format installer available starting
with 0.67 has an option for this.

<p>
(The git commit id listed in Fixed-in is actually <em>after</em> 0.67,
even though 0.67 has an MSI installer. That's not an error; I prepared
the 0.67 MSI ad-hoc, after 0.67 itself was released.)
