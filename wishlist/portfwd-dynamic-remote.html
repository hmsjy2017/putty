<b>summary</b>: Remote-to-local SOCKS-based dynamic port forwarding<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>low:</i> We aren&#x27;t sure whether to fix this or not.<br>
<p>PuTTY doesn't currently support the remote-to-local direction of
dynamic port forwarding, i.e. opening a listening port on the SSH
<em>server</em> which functions as a SOCKS server, and responds to
requests by making network connections on the client side.

<p>This wouldn't be too difficult to implement in principle. The PuTTY
code base already contains all the necessary pieces.

<p>What worries me about it is that there are surely a lot of use
cases that don't really want to expose <em>all</em> of the SSH
client's local network to the SSH server. SSH servers are often
multiuser machines, and a client user's LAN is likely to contain all
kinds of poorly secured internal services, and probably in many cases
you didn't really want to give all the other users on the server
machine access to all those insecure endpoints. So I feel as if, for
many uses of this kind of feature, you'd want some kind of
passlist/blocklist system that lets you configure <em>what</em>
destinations the SOCKS server is willing to let its clients connect
to.

<p>That's not too hard in implementation terms, but it's a lot of
design effort, because there are so many ways you might want to
specify individual passlist/blocklist entries or ranges of them:
<ul>
<li>by exact match or range match on the destination IP address
<li>by exact match or wildcard match on the <em>input</em> hostname
sent down the SOCKS connection (if the server sends one in place of a
numeric address)
<li>by exact match or wildcard match on the <em>canonical</em>
hostname obtained from a DNS lookup of the provided address or name
<li>a bunch of Boolean logic to specify how to combine those
host-based criteria with port numbers, or with each other
</ul>
and so many ways you might organise the whole collection of individual
entries:
<ul>
<li>pure passlist-based system (list of acceptable destinations)
<li>pure blocklist-based system (list of forbidden destinations)
<li>multiple rule types, with a priority order defined explicitly in
the config file
<li>multiple rule types, with an implicit ‘most specific wins’ rule to
decide which entries take priority
<ul>
<li>… but what counts as more specific, out of an IP range and a
canonical-hostname wildcard, which could easily match nontrivially
overlapping sets of hosts and the system doesn't know how large those
sets are?
</ul>
</ul>
By the time you have a full-featured system that can specify all of
those things, you've probably written an almost Turing-complete
configuration language, which is used solely for this one niche
feature of an SSH client. On the other hand, if you leave out any of
this stuff, Murphy's Law guarantees that the next user will
desperately need whichever part you didn't bother with!

<p>So when I've thought about this in the past I've tended to feel
that a more flexible solution is to run a separate SOCKS server on the
client machine, and point an ordinary remote port forwarding at that.
A dedicated SOCKS server program is likely to have some kind of
configuration system <em>already</em> for this kind of thing, so PuTTY
wouldn't have to make up its own from scratch. And there would be
nothing tying this solution to a <em>particular</em> SOCKS server –
you'd be free to use whatever SOCKS server you liked the feature set
of best, instead of being constrained to use only the provided one
with its limited range of configuration.

<p>(Of course, you could have made the same argument about the
existing local-to-remote dynamic forwarding! In the most typical use
case of SSH, running a login session on a remote Unix machine where
you have a full-featured shell account that can run programs of your
choice, there's no reason you couldn't implement <em>that</em>
forwarding mode in exactly the same way, by running a SOCKS server on
the remote machine and forwarding an ordinary port to it. But the
difference is that if you're <em>not</em> in that most typical use
case of SSH – e.g. because your access to the server machine is locked
down, or perhaps it's a special-purpose device in the first place
which can't run arbitrary programs – then you may not have the freedom
to run a SOCKS server remotely. So, in that case, local dynamic
forwarding really is giving you something you couldn't achieve any
other way. Whereas if you're able to run PuTTY on your client machine
then you're probably also able to run a SOCKS server on the
<em>same</em> machine.)
