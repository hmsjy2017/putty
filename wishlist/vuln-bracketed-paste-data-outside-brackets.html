<p>
PuTTY 0.72 introduced a bug in the terminal's handling of xterm
bracketed paste mode, in which the two bracketing escape sequences
could appear together, with the pasted data following them, instead of
between them.

<p>
This is classed as a vulnerability because it's possible that some
terminal applications might have been depending on the bracket
sequences identfiying pasted data in order to prevent it from causing
particular actions, so that a malicious clipboard writer could not
invoke those actions.

<p>
However, if the application was only depending on the brackets to
provide a hint about the semantics of the data (for example, pasting
tab characters physically in an editor instead of treating them as
invocations of an auto-indent command) then there need not be any
security effect.

<p>
This bug was first reported by Axel Sander.
It has been assigned <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-17068">CVE-2019-17068</a>.
