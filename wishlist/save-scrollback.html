<b>summary</b>: Allow saving scrollback to a file (logging formatted terminal output)<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>medium:</i> This should be fixed one day.<br>
<p>
Allow saving of the current screen+scrollback state to a file. Or
printing it, possibly.

<p>
Related: someone suggested that it might be useful to be able to log
stuff to a file as it goes into the scrollback; this would avoid the
problem with `Log printable output only' that characters backspaced
over, etc, are logged. However, lines can in theory be pulled out of
the scrollback and modified, when the window is expanded vertically.

<p>
The right solution to this is to log lines when they're about to fall
off the <em>top</em> of the scrollback. Obviously this will usually
leave rather a lag between things happening and finally being written
to disc; and when the log file is closed, the entire screen and
scrollback state would have to be written to the log to bring it up to
date, which is a rather similar operation to this wish.

<p>
This also has the advantage that each row written to the log file
can sensibly be timestamped, which people
<a href="log-timestamp.html">occasionally ask for</a>.

<p>
This wouldn't log full-screen applications that don't scroll the
screen, but I'm not sure you'd want to.
