<p>When the PuTTY terminal code wants to make a change to the terminal
window properties, the change is not made immediately, but queued
until the next window redraw. This policy was <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=d74308e90e3813af664f91ef8c9d1a0644aa9544">introduced</a>
as a means of limiting the rate at which a server could cause PuTTY to
perform GUI activity, preventing <a href="vuln-windows-remote-title-dos.html">at least one server-triggerable DoS
attack</a>.

<p>One of the window-property changes included in this policy is its
size. When the server sends any of the escape sequences that triggers
a terminal resize (including both the DECCOLM <code>ESC[?3h</code> /
<code>ESC[?3l</code> sequences for 80/132 column switch, and the xterm
general resize sequence
<code>ESC[8;</code><i>H</i><code>;</code><i>W</i><code>t</code>), the
actual resize may not happen until up to 20ms later.

<p>But it's not unreasonable for the server to send a control sequence
to resize the terminal, and then <em>immediately</em> follow that up
with a stream of terminal output that draws a full screen of text in
the expectation that it's drawing on the new window size. So if PuTTY
has not yet enacted the size change, then that redraw can go wrong,
e.g. with lines of text intended for the new terminal width wrapping
at the shorter old width. (Or being truncated, depending on other
terminal settings, but <em>neither</em> of those was what you actually
wanted.)

<p>It's not clear what the best fix for this might be. I can think of
several plausible options:

<p><strong>Revert the rate-limiting for resizes</strong>, and put
things back to the way they used to work, so that window resizes are
enacted synchronously. That <em>might</em> be OK: we don't know for
sure that a significant server-triggered DoS is available relating to
resizes in particular. But it might reintroduce a vulnerability, so
I'd rather not do it that way.

<p><strong>Pause processing of terminal output until a resize
completes</strong>. The physical window resize would still happen at
the same time as it currently does, but until it was finished,
terminal output would remain in <code>terminal.c</code>'s incoming
buffer, waiting for the terminal to be the right size to accept it.
This would introduce up to 20ms of delay in terminal output processing
whenever a resize took place.

<p><strong>Decouple logical and physical terminal resizes</strong>.
Perhaps the most conceptually clean solution, but also the trickiest
to implement: respond to a terminal resize request by immediately
changing the <em>logical</em> size of the terminal screen in the
<code>terminal.c</code> data structures, so that further terminal data
can be immediately processed and will find terminal features like line
wrapping behaving as expected. But the <em>physical</em> resize of the
window, in the GUI, would still wait until the next redraw timer, and
at that point, the window would become the new size and have the new
contents drawn on it.

<p>The biggest problem with this last option is: what happens if the
GUI doesn't give us the window size we asked for? If you try to resize
a window larger than the screen on some GUI platforms (including
Windows), you get a size that will fit in place of the size you
requested. And you don't find this out until you actually attempt the
physical resize in the GUI, and get sent a <code>WM_SIZE</code>
telling you what size you <em>actually</em> got. So in the decoupled
approach, you'd end up already having drawn a load of output to the
terminal data structures in the expectation of getting one size, and
by the time you find you got a different size instead, it's a bit late
to figure out what the screen <em>should</em> have ended up looking
like.

<p>But perhaps that doesn't matter too much, and we should just regard
that later change of mind on the GUI's part as equivalent to a user
action resizing the terminal window. It's not clear.
