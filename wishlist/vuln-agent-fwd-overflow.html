<b>summary</b>: Vulnerability: integer overflow permits memory overwrite by forwarded ssh-agent connections<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>vulnerability:</i> This is a security vulnerability.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>high:</i> This should be fixed in the next release.<br>
<b>present-in</b>: 0.67<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=4ff22863d895cb7ebfced4cf923a012a614adaa8">4ff22863d895cb7ebfced4cf923a012a614adaa8</a> (0.68)<br>
<p>
Many versions of PuTTY prior to 0.68 have a heap-corrupting integer
overflow bug in the <code>ssh_agent_channel_data</code> function
which processes messages sent by remote SSH clients to a forwarded
agent connection.

<p>
The agent protocol begins every message with a 32-bit length field,
which gives the length of the <em>remainder</em> of the message, not
including the length field itself. In order to accumulate the entire
message <em>including</em> the length field in an internal buffer,
PuTTY added 4 to the received length value, to obtain the message
length inclusive of everything. This addition was unfortunately
missing a check for unsigned integer overflow.

<p>
Hence, sending a length field large enough to overflow when 4 is added
to it, such as <code>0xFFFFFFFD</code>, would cause PuTTY to record a
value for the total message length (<code>totallen</code>) which was
smaller than the amount of data it had already seen
(<code>lensofar</code>, which at this point would be 4 bytes for the
length field itself). Then, it would assume that the expression
<code>totallen-lensofar</code> represented the amount of space it was
safe to write into its buffer â€“ but in fact, in the overflowing
case, this value would wrap back round to a number just less than
2<sup>32</sup>, far larger than the allocated heap block, and PuTTY
could be induced to overwrite its heap with data sent by the attacker.

<p>
If your server is running Linux or any reasonably similar Unix, and
has the <code>socat</code> network utility installed, then you can use
this simple proof of concept to determine whether you are affected.
Simply run the shell command
<pre>(echo -ne '\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFD\x0B'; cat /dev/zero) | socat stdio unix-connect:$SSH_AUTH_SOCK</pre>
and PuTTY will crash.

<p>
This bug is only exploitable at all if you have enabled SSH agent
forwarding, which is turned off by default. Moreover, an attacker able
to exploit this bug would have to have already be able to connect to
the Unix-domain socket representing the forwarded agent connection.
Since any attacker with that capability would necessarily already be
able to generate signatures with your agent's stored private keys, you
should in normal circumstances be defended against this vulnerability
by the same precautions you and your operating system were already
taking to prevent untrusted people from accessing your SSH agent.
