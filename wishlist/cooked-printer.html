<b>summary</b>: Feature-rich printer support with formatting control<br>

<p>
Improved ANSI printer control support. Squirting raw data out to a
random printer is all very well for people who already have their
remote application configured with a driver for their specific
printer, but not ideal if you just want to send a text file and have
it print in a sensible sort of way. I'd like an alternative printing
mode using the Windows graphical printing API (where the printing
application has to draw on the page like a canvas), doing the layout
myself. Advantages include being able to guarantee the right number
of columns and rows per page, being able to let the user select
portrait/landscape, and possibly also doing some escape-sequence
parsing on the input data stream to handle a variety of simple
control codes (DEC/ANSI and PCL both spring to mind, and I think the
simple ones of these could both be supported at once without clashes
requiring user-level configuration).

<p>
This is certainly going to be a large piece of code, so if it
happens at all it will want to be a plugin DLL using the plugin
interface.

<p>
In the meantime, if you have something which will emulate your
favourite printer language (e.g. Ghostscript for Postscript), you can
try bolting it on to PuTTY with something like
