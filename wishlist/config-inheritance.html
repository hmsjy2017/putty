<b>summary</b>: Inheritance between saved sessions<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>medium:</i> This should be fixed one day.<br>

Inheritable saved sessions. The way I see this working is that you'd
have a button marked "Inherit" next to the "Load" button. Selecting
an existing saved session and clicking this would give you a
weird-looking config box in which all the features had an indicator
beside them saying they were inherited from the parent session.
Modifying any setting would clear this indicator; clicking the
indicator would set it and revert the setting to the way it is in
the parent. You could then save and launch this session in the usual
way - but if you modified a setting in the parent session which was
inherited rather than locally modified in the child, then the
child's setting would change. So, for example, you could have most
of your day-to-day sessions _inherit_ from Default Settings rather
than copying it, so if you found a nicer font you could change them
all in one go. Of course there'd be no reason an inherited session
couldn't inherit from another inherited session.
