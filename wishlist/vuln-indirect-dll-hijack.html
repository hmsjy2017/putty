<b>summary</b>: Potential malicious code execution via indirect DLL hijacking<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>vulnerability:</i> This is a security vulnerability.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>high:</i> This should be fixed in the next release.<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=9398d230339d5bfaa94093af89a17abf33b5dfad">9398d230339d5bfaa94093af89a17abf33b5dfad</a> 2016-07-19 (0.68)<br>
<p>
On some versions of Windows, all versions of the PuTTY tools up to and
including 0.67 <strong>[BUT NOT ONLY THOSE â€“ see below]</strong>
can end up loading DLLs from the local directory which contains the
PuTTY executables.

<p>
<strong>2017-04-28</strong>: further problems of this form came to
light after 0.68 was released, so 0.68 is <strong>STILL
VULNERABLE</strong>. See <a href="vuln-indirect-dll-hijack-2.html">vuln-indirect-dll-hijack-2</a> for
documentation of the additional problems.

<p>
This can be a problem if that is an uncontrolled location, such as a
browser download directory. If an attacker tricked a user into
downloading a malicious DLL and then the user then ran any PuTTY tool
directly from their download directory, code in the attacker's DLL
could run in the PuTTY process. (This is more likely than it sounds
because at least some versions of some browsers have allowed websites
to drop files into download directories without asking, as described in
<a href="https://textslashplain.com/2015/12/18/dll-hijacking-just-wont-die/">this blog post</a>.)

<p>
We have verified this behaviour ourselves on Windows 7 and
Windows 2008.

<p>
This isn't an issue when the PuTTY tools have been installed properly,
as attackers should not have the opportunity to get their DLLs into
the Program Files directory or elsewhere on the search path (or
rather, if they can, you probably have bigger problems).

<p>
However, the PuTTY <em>installer</em> .exe itself
suffered from the same vulnerability up to and including 0.67, so
running <em>that</em> directly from a browser download directory could
also have led to compromise.
The <a href="msi-installer.html">MSI installer</a>, which debuted with
0.67, does not have this problem, and 0.68's .exe installer does not
either.

<p>
This bug in the PuTTY executables was reported by Sachin Wagh and has
been assigned CVE ID <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6167">CVE-2016-6167</a>.
The equivalent vulnerability in the PuTTY .exe installer was reported
to us by Stefan Kanthak.

<p>
<em>Vulnerability and mitigation details:</em>
While PuTTY had already been somewhat careful about where it
explicitly loaded DLLs from since 0.61
(<a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=9f274bed919de23335499926f4abbea45e0e495b">r8993</a>,
<a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=406e62f77b3603f3efd2827930513b8c92e83dae">r9003</a>)
after
<a href="https://isc.sans.edu/diary/DLL+hijacking+vulnerabilities/9445">the last time this came up</a>,
that doesn't help when those DLLs themselves load DLLs, which is the
weakness here. The demonstration used the DLL names UxTheme.dll /
ntmarta.dll, which are apparently sought by standard bits of Windows.

<p>
This has been remedied in the PuTTY executables by calling the
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh310515(v=vs.85).aspx">SetDefaultDllDirectories()</a>
function, on versions of Windows where that is available; that is
fully-patched Windows Vista and up (the Microsoft security update
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2533623/microsoft-security-advisory-insecure-library-loading-could-allow-remote-code-execution">KB2533623</a>
from 2014 is required on Vista, 7, and 2008). The mitigation is not
available on unpatched or older versions of Windows, for which the
only remedy is not to run the PuTTY tools from untrusted locations.

<p>
The fix for the .exe installer's version of this vulnerability was to
<a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=d29d33e165fe83497109dea2fafab4451e2607c3">upgrade</a>
our copy of Inno Setup to 5.5.9, which contains
<a href="https://github.com/jrsoftware/issrc/issues/188">their similar mitigation</a>.

<p>
Microsoft has
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff919712(v=vs.85).aspx">some guidance</a>
about this class of vulnerability.
