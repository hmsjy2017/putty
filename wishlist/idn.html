<b>summary</b>: Support for Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>low:</i> We aren&#x27;t sure whether to fix this or not.<br>
<p>
We've had a couple of requests for IDN support
(<a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc3490.txt">RFC3490</a> et al)
in PuTTY.

<p>
Ideally this would be implemented by the OS. However it's been
suggested to us that Microsoft at least won't add anything "until at
least Longhorn". There are various libraries out there such as the
<a href="http://www.verisign.com/nds/naming/idn/sdk.html">VeriSign IDN SDK</a>
and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libidn/">GNU libidn</a>.

<p>
It's not clear that IDN support in PuTTY is worth the developer effort
or the binary space, given that (presumably) you can just type
<tt>xn--</tt>whatever into the "host name" box.
With (say) a web browser, it is normal to want to access lots of
different web sites you've never visited before, whose addresses
you've got off a cereal packet, and so on; the domain name is a
relatively important part of the process. With PuTTY, you typically
access a small number of sites with which you have prior arrangements,
and often you just put the domain name into a saved session and forget
about it.
