<b>summary</b>: Escape sequence to execute command on the client side<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>never:</i> We don&#x27;t ever intend to fix this.<br>
<p>
People occasionally ask for an escape sequence which will execute an
arbitrary local command, Ã  la ECMA-48 OSC (Operating system
command).

<p>
This feature is horrendously insecure, and PuTTY will not be
implementing it unless someone comes up with some plausible way of
dealing with the security issues outlined below.

<p>
If your terminal is willing to receive an escape sequence which
directs it to run a local program, and will uncomplainingly do it,
then for a start you've just put your client machine completely at the
mercy of your server - so I do hope you <em>never</em> make a
connection to a machine whose sysadmin is less than a close and
trusted friend of yours! What would stop the server sending a
remote-command escape such as <code>del *.*</code>, or (perhaps even
worse) one which read sensitive files on your disk and sent them out
to somewhere the malicious server admin could recover them? And even
if your server admin is trustworthy, his machine could be cracked, and
then your client box is at the mercy of the cracker.

<p>
Furthermore, applications such as Unix `write' often don't filter
escape sequences out of their output, so if you <em>ever</em> have
messages enabled then you've handed control of your local machine to
any user of the same server who might want it.

<p>
In general, your terminal stream should be considered untrusted for
these purposes. Users don't normally feel nervous about running `cat'
on unknown files just to see what's in them; they tend to feel that
the worst that can happen as a result is that they screw up their
terminal state and have to reset it - and many users don't even expect
<em>that</em>, and come and complain to us when it happens (see
<a href="../faq.html#faq-puttyputty">the FAQ</a>).
If your terminal is willing to run arbitrary local commands when
told to by an escape sequence, then you have to adopt a whole new
level of paranoia, where (for example) any file not trusted by you is
viewed using `cat -v' rather than `cat', and only when you're certain
that it's clean of malicious escape sequences do you progress to
`cat'.

<p>
An alternative remote-execution solution with authentication is
