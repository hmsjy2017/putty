<b>summary</b>: Ability to remove close box from window<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>never:</i> We don&#x27;t ever intend to fix this.<br>
<p>We're frequently asked for an option to either remove the close button from
PuTTY's window title, or to disable it.  This is usually because some server
to which PuTTY is connecting requires incoming sessions to be terminated
in a particular way, and can't cope with the connection being dropped.
We have no intention of implementing this.

<p>If you have the user's
co-operation, the "warn before closing window" option should be
sufficient to prevent them accidentally closing the window.  If you
don't have their co-operation, then they could just use the Task Manager
when the found that PuTTY's close button wasn't working.  In neither of 
these cases would disabling the close button help significantly.

<p>In any case, the server has to be able to cope gracefully with the loss
of a connection, since this could happen in the event of PuTTY's, or the
client computer's crashing.  Once this is done, there should be no need to
prevent PuTTY closing.
