<b>summary</b>: In-process proxy SSH connections (like OpenSSH&#x27;s -J/ProxyJump)<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>medium:</i> This should be fixed one day.<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=0d3bb73608f1a5d1d5337e51736d48dad1436af5">0d3bb73608f1a5d1d5337e51736d48dad1436af5</a><br>
<p>
The ability to connect to an SSH server 'A' by first making an SSH
connection to an intermediate server 'B' (sometimes called a 'bastion'
or 'jump host'), and using that connection to open a tunnel to A's SSH
server port.

<p>
This is already possible in PuTTY using the 'Local' proxy type with a
command (specified in the 'Proxy hostname' field) like
'<tt>plink -batch %proxyhost -nc %host:%port</tt>', but it's fiddly
– requiring the separate Plink executable to be installed and
identified – and doesn't allow you to interact with the
intermediate host, for instance to enter a password.

<p>
Having a single PuTTY instance manage both SSH connections would make
it possible to avoid these problems. (This is similar to what OpenSSH
has implemented since
<a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-7.3">7.3</a> with its
<tt>-J</tt> / <tt>ProxyJump</tt> feature.)

<p>
<em>Current status, May 2021:</em> an early version of such a feature
is available in the development snapshots, as the "SSH" option on the
"Proxy" tab. Its limitations are well described in
<a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=0d3bb73608f1a5d1d5337e51736d48dad1436af5">the initial commit message</a>;
a major one is that it doesn't yet actually support interacting with
the intermediate host.

<p>
Since the 'Proxy hostname' field can identify a PuTTY saved session as
well as a hostname, the intermediate host can have its own
configuration, such as using a particular key file. This allow allows
multi-hop jump paths, if the saved session for the intermediate host
is itself configured to use an SSH proxy; similarly, it allows the
feature to be used in combination with a non-SSH proxy.
