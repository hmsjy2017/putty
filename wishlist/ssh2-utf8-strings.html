<b>summary</b>: SSH-2 message strings etc should be in UTF-8<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>bug:</i> This is clearly an actual problem we want fixed.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>medium:</i> This should be fixed one day.<br>
<b>present-in</b>: 2005-01-19 2009-08-29<br>
<p>
All of the human-readable and human-supplied strings in SSH-2,
including user names, passwords, banners, and error messages, are
specified to be encoded in UTF-8.  PuTTY currently ignores this and
uses whatever character-set the terminal happens to be configured to
use instead.  This is likely to cause trouble with passwords
containing non-ASCII characters, for instance.

<p>
Fixing this is relatively easy in PuTTY, where it's possible for the
SSH code to poke around in the terminal's state.  It's not so easy for
plink and PSFTP, which will need to gain an understanding of character
sets.

<p>
The OpenSSH client, which has much the same problem as plink, doesn't
attempt to have an opinion on character sets (at least as of 5.1p1);
everything will work according to the standard if the user's terminal
is in UTF-8 mode, and not otherwise, regardless of the locale that
OpenSSH is running in.

<p>
So it's possible to end up with a setup that mostly works but strictly
breaches the standard. For instance, a multi-hop scenario where the user's
terminal is in ISO-8859-1, and the end server's banner (say) is also
in that character set (illegally), but an intermediate client/server
running the OpenSSH client (or Plink) has a UTF-8 locale, works today
but would break if the intermediate client started having an opinion
on character sets.

<p>
Given this, if we fix this item, will we need an option to revert to
our old (non-standard) behaviour -- using the configured terminal
character set -- to cope with setups that have ended up looking like
this?

<p>
<em>Update, March 2019:</em> we still don't force interpretation of
these strings as UTF-8 -- it's still up to the terminal or locale
configuration -- but we've at least made our code to strip control
characters from many of these strings more sophisticated; so if the
server sends UTF-8 printable characters in something like an
authentication prompt, and the terminal or locale are configured to
accept UTF-8, the PuTTY tools will no longer gratuitously mangle them.
