<b>summary</b>: Option to start key sequences with 0x9B instead of 0x1B<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>low:</i> We aren&#x27;t sure whether to fix this or not.<br>
<p>
Debian apparently has a terminal type <code>xterm-8bit</code> where
all occurrences of 0x1B in key sequences (such as function keys) are
replaced by 0x9B.

<p>
This gets rid of the irritating delay on pressing Esc while the server
works out of it's part of a multi-byte sequence or not.

<p>
It's been suggested that PuTTY should have an option to work like
this.

<p>
<b>SGT adds</b>: This sounds like a nice simple feature on the face
of it, but unfortunately UTF-8 complicates it a lot. What should
happen when the terminal is in UTF-8 mode (or, hypothetically and if
we ever get round to it, some other multi-byte character encoding)?
Should we send a bare 9B <em>anyway</em>, causing an illegal UTF-8
sequence but keeping compatibility with any software which is
scanning the incoming byte stream for a precise sequence of
<em>bytes</em>? Or should we send C2 9B, the UTF-8 encoding of
U+009B? Or should we simply outlaw this mode completely in UTF-8
mode?
