<b>summary</b>: Remove fallbacks between SSH-2 and SSH-1<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>high:</i> This should be fixed in the next release.<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=16dfefcbdedb00354860adb32034ac0f3791833c">16dfefcbdedb00354860adb32034ac0f3791833c</a> 2016-04-03 (0.68)<br>
<p>
While it's still apparently necessary to support the obsolete SSH-1
protocol to connect to some outdated servers, these days it should
really be treated as a separate and insecure protocol, like Telnet or
Rlogin, and only used if the user explicitly requests it.

<p>
PuTTY currently supports a mode ('Preferred SSH protocol version' of
'2' rather than '2 only') where it will prefer to use the modern SSH-2
protocol, but will quietly fall back to SSH-1 if that's all the server
appears to support. PuTTY used in this mode is open to a protocol
downgrade attack; while the SSH-2 protocol exchange is set up to spot
an active attacker tampering with version strings, algorithm choices
and the like (provided that you have been careful about trusting the
host key), that can't prevent downgrade to SSH-1, and after that
further downgrade attacks are possible.

<p>
While it is not yet known to be trivial to exploit this, SSH-1 is now
sufficiently rare that it's not worth the risk.

<p>
(One sign that it might be happening to you is being unexpectedly
prompted for a new "rsa" host key; this would <b>not</b> be flagged as
"WARNING - POTENTIAL SECURITY BREACH". In PuTTY 0.67 and before, this
can also occur legitimately in SSH-2 if the server adds a new host key
type but the key type would not be "rsa", which is SSH-1 specific;
"rsa2" is the name of the RSA key type for SSH-2.)

<p>
Current versions of PuTTY default to not allowing fallback to SSH-1,
but the default only <a href="ssh2-only-default.html">changed</a> in
0.64 (early 2015), so there will be plenty of long-time users whose
untouched settings leave them vulnerable to such a downgrade attack.

<p>
So: change "Preferred SSH protocol version" to just "SSH protocol
version", and offer just two options "2" and "1", which behave the
same way that "2 only" and "1 only" did in previous versions. (The
'-2' and '-1' command-line options already behave like this.)
Existing sessions that use the old settings instead use the equivalent
no-fallback behaviour. The net result is that a PuTTY configuration
that permits SSH-1 can no longer be used to connect to a server that
only supports SSH-2, leaving it open to a downgrade attack in the
future.

<p>
Most users will be connecting to SSH-2-supporting servers with a
configuration that prefers SSH-2 (the default since
<a href="ssh2-default.html">0.54 in 2004</a>) so will see no change.
If you were relying on the fallback, your session will now fail and
you'll have to change your settings to explicitly acknowledge the
protocol version in use; if you discover that you need SSH-1, you
might want to try to upgrade your server if possible.

<p>
(Compare
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=807107">Debian's approach</a>,
where you will also have to explicitly opt in to allowing SSH-1 by
invoking the 'ssh1' command instead of 'ssh'.)
