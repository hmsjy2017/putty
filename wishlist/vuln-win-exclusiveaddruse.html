<b>summary</b>: Vulnerability: Windows local forwarded ports rebindable by another application<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>vulnerability:</i> This is a security vulnerability.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>high:</i> This should be fixed in the next release.<br>

<b>fixed-in</b>: 0.73 <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=15653f67e8559787d021dda415d93696e98d1804">15653f67e8559787d021dda415d93696e98d1804</a><br>
<p>
In all versions of PuTTY between 0.52 (when port forwarding was
introduced) and 0.72 inclusive, when PuTTY listens on a local TCP/IP
port for port-forwarding purposes, it does not set the
<code>SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE</code> flag which tells Windows to prevent
another application from binding a listening socket to the same port.

<p>
As a result, a malicious process running on the same machine would be
able to bind to the same port, and intercept some of the incoming
connections for its own purposes. Those purposes might include
performing a MITM attack on the connection, forwarding the modified
data back to the same port.

<p>
(To confuse matters further, PuTTY was setting the
<code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> socket option, meaning that it behaved
somewhat like such a malicious process itself â€“ it could take
over a listening port from another process.
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/winsock/using-so-reuseaddr-and-so-exclusiveaddruse">This article</a>
describes the behaviour of <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> and
<code>SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE</code> on Windows. The probable <i>reason</i>
for PuTTY setting <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> was that we knew that it's
necessary with Unix-derived IP stacks, to avoid trouble re-binding
ports involved in <code>TIME_WAIT</code> connections, and assumed
it was necessary everywhere; but on Windows, it's not needed for
that, and turns out to be actively harmful. So PuTTY no longer sets
<code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> on Windows. This didn't itself cause a
vulnerability.)
