<b>summary</b>: Trouble when SSH channel closed with outstanding requests<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>semi-bug:</i> This might or might not be a bug, depending on your precise definition of what a bug is.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>taxing:</i> Needs external things we don&#x27;t have (standards, users etc)<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: r10200 <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=aaaf70a0fc0f071b9e9c6a51606c78b16a464841">aaaf70a0fc0f071b9e9c6a51606c78b16a464841</a> 2014-07-07 (0.64)<br>
<p>
There's been a long-standing problem with closing channels within an
SSH session due to an ambiguity in the SSH-2 specification
about what happens to CHANNEL_REQUESTs that are outstanding at the
point a channel is closed, and a consequent variance in behaviour
among SSH implementations. This leads to a small probability of
trouble each time a channel is closed when connected to certain
servers, which shows up particularly when forwarding X connections or
browser traffic.

<p>
A discussion on the IETF SSH protocol implementers' list in April 2014
yielded a consensus (that channel closure cancels outstanding channel
requests). As of this change (first released in 0.64), PuTTY
implements and expects the consensus behaviour, and has a
<a href="https://tartarus.org/~simon/putty-snapshots/htmldoc/Chapter4.html#config-ssh-bug-chanreq">bug-compatibility mode</a>
'Replies to channel requests after channel close' for servers that
implement the other common behaviour (which detects
<a href="https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1818">OpenSSH prior to 6.7</a>
automatically).

<p>
In versions of PuTTY prior to 0.63 (which implemented what is now the
consensus behaviour), this confusion could lead to symptoms such as
PuTTY closing connections with messages like "Disconnected: Received
SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_FAILURE for nonexistent channel 257" when connecting
to servers like OpenSSH prior to 6.7.

<p>
PuTTY's behaviour changed in 0.63, to what is now considered incorrect
behaviour, in pursuit of <a href="half-closed.html">half-closed</a>; it
held off sending CHANNEL_CLOSE itself until it had seen responses to
all its outstanding channel requests. Unfortunately this could lead to
hangs when talking to servers implementing what is now the consensus
behaviour (such as Dropbear, which changed to this behaviour in 0.52
<a href="flow-control.html">according to our notes</a>).

<p>
In 0.64, PuTTY's behaviour reverted to what is now the consensus.
While users should not see a regression with old OpenSSH due to the
automatic bug detection, server implementations not covered by that
detection may cause a recurrence of the "nonexistent channel" message,
in which case you'll have to set the bug-compatibility setting
manually.

<p>
(Since the situation arises mostly with the 
<a href="https://tartarus.org/~simon/putty-snapshots/htmldoc/AppendixF.html#sshnames-channel">`winadj' messages</a>
PuTTY has sent <a href="flow-control.html">since 0.61</a>, a partial
workaround for PuTTY 0.61, 0.62, and 0.63 was to set the "Chokes on
PuTTY's SSH-2 'winadj' requests" bug-compatibility mode.)
