<b>summary</b>: Dynamic host key policy leaks information about known host keys<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>vulnerability:</i> This is a security vulnerability.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>high:</i> This should be fixed in the next release.<br>
<b>absent-in</b>: 0.67<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=08f1e2a5066ea95559945af339a60ca14560d764">08f1e2a5066ea95559945af339a60ca14560d764</a> 0.74<br>
<p>
PuTTY 0.68 <a href="hostkey-prefer-cached.html">introduced a dynamic
policy</a> for setting the host key preference order in the
<code>SSH_MSG_KEXINIT</code> message. Host key types for which the
client already has a stored host key are promoted to the top of the
list. This ensures that if the client does have at least one stored
key for the server, then one of those keys will be used in the
connection.
</p>

<p>
Without this option, if you already had a host key stored, and the
server acquired a new key higher up PuTTY's default preference order
(e.g. an <code>sshd</code> upgrade caused an Ed25519 key to be
generated when previously the host only had RSA), the client would ask
you to confirm the new key, even though you already knew a key you
could use to talk to that host safely.
</p>

<p>
However, this policy has a downside as well as an upside. The list of
host key types is sent in cleartext in the first
<code>SSH_MSG_KEXINIT</code> message of the connection. So a network
snooper eavesdropping on all your SSH connections will notice the
different orders of host key preference used for different hosts, and
can use those to make a guess about which servers you already have
host keys for, and which ones you're connecting to for the first time.
</p>

<p>
So, if you're the kind of user who clicks "accept" to new host keys
without checking them out of band (the TOFU policy – Trust On First
Use), and if an active attacker is intending to substitute fake host
 in your SSH connections, then they might be able to use this clue
to substitute fake keys for only the hosts you don't already have keys
for, which might reduce their risk of being detected when performing
that attack.
</p>

<p>
PuTTY 0.74 comes with a new configuration option in the SSH > Host
keys panel: “Prefer algorithms for which a host key is known”. This
option is on by default. If you turn it off, you can revert to the
pre-0.68 policy in which the same host key preference order is used
regardless of the keys you already have cached for a given server.
</p>

<p>
Our analysis is that this is a choice with pros and cons on each side.
Taking several classes of user in turn:
</p>

<dl>

<dt>The “model” user who checks host keys out of band:</dt>

<dd>
<p>
We think this user benefits from the default dynamic policy. (These
are the users for whom we introduced it in the first place.)
</p>
<p>
Checking host keys out of band is awkward, and sometimes not possible
(if you can't contact the admin of the server by other methods at the
time you need to make the connection). So it's desirable to avoid it
whenever possible.
</p>
<p>
The information leak is not important to this class of user, because
an attacker substituting a phony host key will be detected anyway by
the out-of-band check.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>The “oblivious” user who always clicks yes to new host keys (but not to changed ones of the same type):</dt>

<dd>
<p>
For this user, it makes very little difference which option they
select!
</p>
<p>
Suppose they turn off the dynamic host key policy, and the
active attacker tries to fake a host key for an already-known server,
in a case where they would otherwise have been warned off by a changed
preference order.
</p>
<p>
In most cases this will mean that the server does
not provide the host key type at the <em>top</em> of PuTTY's
preference list (or else the preference order would have been the same
<em>even</em> with the dynamic policy enabled). So the attacker could
substitute that topmost host key type in any case, and still not be
detected.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>The “semi-oblivious” user who clicks yes to new hosts, but checks up on old hosts offering new key types:</dt>

<dd>
<p>
This is the class of user who is likely to benefit from turning the
dynamic policy off, because in this case, the attacker will be misled
into trying to attack a connection to an already-known server; they
will substitute a host key of a type the server does not provide; and
the semi-oblivious user will notice, and check up on it, and detect
the attack.
</p>
</dd>

All of this analysis assumes that the user has not meddled with the
default host key preference order in the PuTTY configuration. If they
do – and, especially, if they change it differently depending on the
saved session – then they can probably completely confuse this
hypothetical attacker in any case.

This potential vulnerability was reported to us by the Competence
Center for IT security at the FZI Research Center for Information
Technology. They have assigned it the id FZI-2020-5, and Mitre
assigned it <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-14002">CVE-2020-14002</a>. Here is their own
