<b>summary</b>: On Windows, parent session doesn&#x27;t close until child does<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>semi-bug:</i> This might or might not be a bug, depending on your precise definition of what a bug is.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>present-in</b>: 0.57 0.58 2005-07-11 2005-08-04<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=4455604dbce2d175ce1d601d51472bb1b0a535d8">4455604dbce2d175ce1d601d51472bb1b0a535d8</a> (0.69)<br>
<p>
On Win2K/XP, if a session B is started via "Duplicate Session" from
a previous session A, the connection associated with A doesn't go away
on the server until session B is closed (the TCP connection remains up
as seen by <tt>netstat</tt> on both client and server). This can cause
processes to hang around, especially if session A is closed rudely
(with Alt-F4, for example).

<p>
This isn't observed on Win98.

<p>
This is presumably the sort of inheritance of handles/sockets that
r5468 was supposed to deal with. In 0.57 (prior to that change),
the same occurs with "New Session" too, which lends support to that
theory. (I didn't observe this with 0.58, although there is a
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=1118856270.523545.40240%40g14g2000cwa.googlegroups.com">report</a>
of it happening even there with 0.58 on XP.)

<p>
We might want to make all our sockets non-inheritable with
<code>DuplicateHandle()</code>/<code>CloseHandle()</code>. (I haven't
found documentation of how you get a handle from a socket, but I've
been assured that a socket <em>is</em> a handle, and can just be
passed in with appropriate casts.)

<p>
When <a href="config-struct.html">config-struct</a> is implemented,
it might be possible to avoid passing strange handles about entirely,
which might avoid this sort of problem.
