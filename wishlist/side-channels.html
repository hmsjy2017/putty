<b>summary</b>: Rewrite crypto code to avoid cache/timing side channels<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>semi-bug:</i> This might or might not be a bug, depending on your precise definition of what a bug is.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=9cb8c4bcb78fd3388f10ed626e853a225c33faed">9cb8c4bcb78fd3388f10ed626e853a225c33faed</a> (0.71)<br>
<p>
Between the 0.70 and 0.71 releases, a great deal of PuTTY's
cryptographic code has been substantially rewritten to try to
eliminate cache and timing side channels.

<p>
This is often referred to as ‘constant-time’ coding – see for example
BearSSL's page entitled <a
href="https://www.bearssl.org/constanttime.html">‘Constant-Time
Crypto’</a>. However, that's a misnomer: firstly, timing is not the
only consideration (you <em>also</em> need to avoid leaving sensitive
data in the cache state), and secondly you can't make your code run in
<em>actually constant</em> time, because it can be sped up or slowed
down by many factors outside your control such as thermal CPU
throttling, prior states of caches and branch predictors, or
straight-up system load. Fortunately, you don't actually <em>need</em>
the time to be literally constant; you only need it to be independent
of your secret data (keys and plaintexts). Some alternative phrase
such as ‘secret-independence’ would be better.

<p>
Anyway, be that as it may, we've rewritten the following components of
PuTTY in that style for 0.71:
<ul>
<li>All the bignum-handling code (used in RSA, DSA, and elliptic curve
algorithms)
<li>All the elliptic-curve code itself (the layer above the bignums)
<li>The AES and DES block ciphers.
<li>The CRC32 function that SSH-1 uses in place of a MAC.
</ul>

<p>
All of the affected code will run more slowly as a result of this
rewrite. We haven't done detailed benchmarking on the asymmetric
crypto used only in key exchange, but SGT's measurements on the bulk
encryption suggest a factor of 4.5 slowdown for DES, and about 2 for
software AES in SDCTR mode. AES in CBC mode will be slower still,
because CBC encryption can't be parallelised.

<p>
However, on modern hardware, the software AES implementation will
typically not be used, because we've also provided
hardware-accelerated implementations: see <a href="cpu-crypto-accel.html">cpu-crypto-accel</a>.
So, in the usual case where you're running on a system with hardware
AES acceleration available and connecting to a server that speaks AES,
you should find that PuTTY 0.71's bulk encryption is <em>faster</em>
overall than 0.70's.

<p>
The following components of PuTTY have not been rewritten, but testing
suggested that they already had the required secret-independence
properties:
<ul>
<li>The Chacha20-Poly1305 combined cipher and MAC.
<li>All the standalone hash functions: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512.
</ul>

<p>
Finally, the following components <b>still have cache and timing side
channels</b>, because rewriting them would make them so slow as to be
virtually useless:
<ul>
<li>The Blowfish block cipher.
<li>The Arcfour (aka RC4) stream cipher.
</ul>
In recognition of this, Blowfish has been demoted to below the ‘weak
algorithm’ warning threshold in PuTTY's default configuration. Arcfour
was already below that threshold.

<p>
This work also included creating some test suites:
<ul>
<li>A functional test suite for crypto primitives and supporting
libraries.
<li>A test suite that checks for side channels, based on
