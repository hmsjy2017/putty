<b>summary</b>: Occasional &quot;server&#x27;s host key did not match the signature supplied&quot;<br>

<p>
We've had several as-yet-unexplained reports of this (SSH-2
specific) error message, which may represent a bug in PuTTY or in an
SSH server, or perhaps data corruption in between. They've been
difficult to reproduce.

<p>
To determine for sure whether the problem lies in PuTTY or not, we
need extra information from a diagnostic build which we can provide,
as well as the ordinary SSH packet log.

<p>
One interesting report had both this SSH-2 failure, and the SSH-1
failure "Incorrect CRC received on packet", occurring reproducibly
on the <em>same</em> machine, and no other. Some further digging
into the SSH-1 problem by our correspondent indicated that PuTTY's
<tt>rsaencrypt()</tt> function was playing up; and they found that
with their compiler ("Microsoft (R) 32-bit C/C++ Optimizing Compiler
Version 13.10.3077 for 80x86") adding <tt>/Od</tt> (disable all
optimisations) made the problem go away.
