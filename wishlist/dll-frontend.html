<b>summary</b>: SSH client packaged as a DLL for use in other programs<br>

<p>
A lot of people ask for a DLL that implements an SSH client, so that
they can include it in their own programs and automatically get
securely in touch with other systems and issue commands.

<p>
I'm not entirely sure when (or whether) we'll have the energy to get
round to this, but I've thought about the design aspects a fair bit,
and this is what I've come up with.

<p>
When I hear "DLL for PuTTY" I tend to think of something very much
like Plink, but using a very simple sort of function-call interface
rather than reading from stdin and writing to stdout. Something like
this:

<pre>
  SSH_Session mysess;
  SSH_Channel mychan;
  
  mysess = puttydll_open("myhost.example.com", 22);
  mychan = puttydll_start_command(mysess, "cvs server");
  puttydll_send_data(mychan, cvs_auth_data, len);
  len = puttydll_read_data(mychan, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
</pre>

<p>... and so on. So you'd end up with `<code>SSH_Channel</code>'
handles which worked a little like file handles - you could do a
blocking read on a particular one of them, for example, or wait
until one of a selection of them became ready. (If you wanted to
wait for data from either an SSH channel or a Windows-side object,
interfacing between this sort of <code>select()</code> and the
Windows equivalents might be fun, but I'm sure it could be worked
out. Perhaps an API function which would hand you a Windows event
object that would get set when one of the channels was active.)

<p>The biggest immediate problems I see with it are:

<ul>
<li>
PuTTY needs its own event loop, so that it can respond to server-
side requests (such as repeat key exchange and server-side pings) in
the SSH connection it's managing. This might not be easy to
integrate with whatever kind of event loop the calling program is
using - if indeed it's using an event loop at all; the kind of code
I quote above would probably much rather stay sequential than become
event-driven with explicit state. Hence I think the simplest way to
arrange this is to have the DLL spawn a thread to manage PuTTY's own
network event loop, which can then run without interfering with what
the rest of the program is doing. That way, the calling program
could call the send-data function, go off and do its own thing for a
while, and then come back and see if data had come back for it to
read yet.

<li>
(On the other hand, if the caller <em>did</em> want to integrate
PuTTY into their own event loop so that they received immediate
notification when data came in, that would be another thing we'd
want to allow them to do. Perhaps allowing them to provide an event
object which we could set when particular things happened might be a
useful approach.)

<li>
The DLL interface would need careful design. In particular, what
should happen about interactive prompts - passwords, passphrases,
host key verification, and so on? Should all of those things be
fatal errors (limiting the DLL to being used in a context where
unattended login is possible), or what? I think it would be a
mistake to have this sort of prompt go directly to the user; it
would probably be better to notify the calling program in some way,
and leave it to decide how to handle it. (Although perhaps providing
helper routines that gave standard dialog boxes for these prompts
might also be an interesting option.)

</ul>

<p> However, none of those issues is insurmountable, and once
they're taken care of I don't see why a DLL providing an API like
the one above shouldn't be perfectly possible to write just by
implementing a single front-end module to replace (say)
<code>plink.c</code>.

<p>
There's a third-party DLL encapsulation, W-PuTTY-CD, on our
