<b>summary</b>: Compress shipped PuTTY binaries with a tool such as UPX<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>never:</i> We don&#x27;t ever intend to fix this.<br>
<p>
Occasionally it's suggested that we compress the PuTTY binaries on
our website with tools such as
<a href="http://upx.sourceforge.net/">UPX</a>.

<p>
While it's an interesting idea, it's not currently for us.
<ul>
<li>
Firstly, PuTTY is already quite small and you can comfortably carry
around the PuTTY tools you're likely to use frequently on a floppy
disk.
</li>
<li>
Secondly, and more importantly, we provide cryptographic signatures of
the binaries we've generated with our compilers.  We're as confident
as we can be that they've not been tampered with between being built
and being signed; UPXing the binaries would make us a lot less
confident of this.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
In short, if you want to UPX the binaries, fine, but at the moment
we're not planning to.
