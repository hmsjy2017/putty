The following command is designed to pipe through a remote command back to  
the local host and demonstrates an issue found while using mercurial.  I  
have looked through your existing bug list but failed to spot anything  
similar.

dir | PLINK.EXE -v -ssh -l duncan -i "C:\Program Files\PuTTY\hugo.ppk"  
remote_host cat > tmp

fails on 0.59 and 2007-03-21:r7403.  works on 0.58.

This particular instance of "Unable to read from standard input" should
be fixed now:
<pre>
> Does that fix the "Unable to read from standard input" bug?

The answer, currently, is `I don't know'. It certainly fixes _a_ bug which
gives rise to that error message: if you do something along the lines of

  echo -e 'wibble\nscrark' | plink foovax sort

then you should now no longer get that error.

However, I can't be sure that the same error when doing complicated things
launched from a service is due to the same Windows error, so it might not fix
all instances of the problem. This is why I also added more detailed error
reporting to that error message, so that if any instances of the problem remain
we'll have more information with which to investigate them.

It turns out there are more instances of this; see
