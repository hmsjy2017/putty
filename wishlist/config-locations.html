<b>summary</b>: Store configuration in disk file, HKEY_ALL_USERS, other locations<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>

<b>blocks</b>: <em><a href="cmdline-any-option.html">cmdline-any-option</a></em> <a href="config-struct.html">config-struct</a><br>

<p>
PuTTY stores its configuration and host keys in the registry under
HKEY_CURRENT_USER, because we think that by and large that is the
best single location for the job. However, not everybody agrees, and
often for good reason. People carrying PuTTY around on a USB key tend
to want to store their configuration in a disk file on the same
device, so they can take absolutely everything with them from place
to place. (See
<a href="https://tartarus.org/~simon/putty-snapshots/htmldoc/Chapter4.html#config-file">the docs</a>
for a current hack to do this, which assumes you have write access to
your registry.) Sysadmins could very well want to store system-wide
configuration in HKEY_ALL_USERS or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.

<p>
The major difficulty with this work is one of design: if there are
contradictory things stored in several of these locations, which one
should take priority? It seems fairly obvious that HKEY_CURRENT_USER
or a disk file represent the choices of an individual user, and
therefore they should override HKEY_ALL_USERS or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
which merely set defaults over a large number of users. But which of
CURRENT_USER and a disk file takes priority? Which of ALL_USERS and
LOCAL_MACHINE? You can make a case for either one either way.

<p>
After some consideration, I think that probably the simplest thing
would be for each config location (CURRENT_USER, ALL_USERS,
LOCAL_MACHINE and disk files) to contain a single "Priority" field -
so that a sysadmin could arrange for either of ALL and LOCAL to
have higher priority than the other, depending on local needs. PuTTY
should scan all config locations and use the priority order it
finds. Priorities should be unbounded, so that the local user can
always ensure they have a setup which supersedes the systemwide one.

<p>
Another question is how to tell PuTTY about a disk file. Specifying
it on the command line is one obvious way, but not a particularly
convenient one to set up. Alternatively it could be stored in the
Registry somewhere - but where? Within one of these interchangeable
config locations (in which case, what happens if a disk file
specifies another disk file? Should that be allowed?), or in one
single place?

<p>
Should PuTTY look for a disk file in the directory it was run from,
and if found, use that in the first instance? (Supports convenient
`run from a pen-drive' operation.)

<p>
Finally, although the above design makes it obvious how PuTTY should
<em>read</em> its configuration, how should it write it? When the
user wants to save a config change, where should it be saved to?

<p>
Some people have got fed up waiting for us to sort the design issues
out, and made forks of PuTTY which store settings in files; some of
these can be found on our <a href="../links.html">Links page</a>.
