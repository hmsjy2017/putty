<b>summary</b>: Drag and drop support<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>low:</i> We aren&#x27;t sure whether to fix this or not.<br>
<p>
It might be handy if PuTTY supported drag and drop. Applications
like Word let you select some text and drag that text around the
document; if you drag it into PuTTY it would be nice if PuTTY would
interpret that like a paste operation. Possibly allowing users to
drag the PuTTY selection out into other windows might be nice too,
although this would require some careful thought to work out how it
would interact with the existing mouse behaviour. (Perhaps there is
no way to make them compatible. Perhaps being able to drag the PuTTY
selection would have to be something you have to configure on.)

<p>
Similarly, dragging a URL from a web browser should paste that URL
into PuTTY. And perhaps other sorts of drag-and-drop should do
plausible things as well.

<p>
(A lot of people ask to be able to drag and drop a file out of
Windows Explorer into PuTTY, and have it automatically start up an
SCP process to copy that file into the current directory of the
remote shell. This is not even feasible in theory - there's no
reliable way for PuTTY to determine what the currect directory of
the remote shell <em>is</em>. It could be done in principle if you
didn't mind the files ending up in your home directory rather than
your current one, but that's a lot less useful and I doubt we'd
consider it worth the rather complex modifications to PuTTY.)
