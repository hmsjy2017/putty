<b>summary</b>: Drag and drop support<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>wish:</i> This is a request for an enhancement.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>tricky:</i> Needs many tuits.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>low:</i> We aren&#x27;t sure whether to fix this or not.<br>
<p>
It might be handy if PuTTY supported drag and drop. Applications
like Word let you select some text and drag that text around the
document; if you drag it into PuTTY it would be nice if PuTTY would
interpret that like a paste operation. Possibly allowing users to
drag the PuTTY selection out into other windows might be nice too,
although this would require some careful thought to work out how it
would interact with the existing mouse behaviour. (Perhaps there is
no way to make them compatible. Perhaps being able to drag the PuTTY
selection would have to be something you have to configure on.)

<p>
Similarly, dragging a URL from a web browser should paste that URL
into PuTTY. And perhaps other sorts of drag-and-drop should do
plausible things as well.

<p>
Another completely different use of drag and drop would be to drag a
file out of Windows Explorer into a PuTTY window, and if that window
is in SSH mode, have it automatically start up an auxiliary SFTP
channel and use it to upload the file to the server.

<p>
(In that situation, there would have to be a designated upload
directory for the dragged file to land in. Some users have suggested a
version in which it lands in your shell's current directory. That is
not sensibly possible, and it has its own writeup at Mayhem difficulty
in <a href="drag-drop-to-cwd.html">drag-drop-to-cwd</a>.)
