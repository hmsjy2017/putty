<b>summary</b>: Vulnerability: old-style scp downloads may allow remote code execution<br>
<b>class</b>: <i>vulnerability:</i> This is a security vulnerability.<br>
<b>difficulty</b>: <i>fun:</i> Just needs tuits, and not many of them.<br>
<b>priority</b>: <i>high:</i> This should be fixed in the next release.<br>
<b>present-in</b>: 0.66<br>
<b>fixed-in</b>: 0.67 <a href="https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commitdiff;h=bc6c15ab5f636e05b7e91883f0031a7e06117947">bc6c15ab5f636e05b7e91883f0031a7e06117947</a><br>
<p>
Many versions of PSCP prior to 0.67 have a stack corruption
vulnerability in their treatment of the 'sink' direction (i.e.
downloading from server to client) of the old-style SCP protocol.

<p>
In order for this vulnerability to be exploited, the user must connect
to a malicious server and attempt to download any file.

<p>
(Note however that the vulnerability kicks in <em>after</em> host key
verification, so the host key of the server has to have been
accepted to get this far.)

<p>
This vulnerability only arises in the old SCP protocol, so you can
work around it in a vulnerable PSCP by using the <code>-sftp</code>
option to force the use of the newer SFTP protocol, provided your
server supports that protocol.

<p>
This bug was discovered by
<a href="https://github.com/tintinweb/pub/tree/master/pocs/">tintinweb</a>
and has been assigned CVE ID <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2563">CVE-2016-2563</a>.

<p>
<em>Vulnerability details:</em>
Prior to any download in the SCP sink protocol, the server sends a
line of text consisting of an octal number encoding Unix file
permissions, a decimal number encoding the file size, and the file
name. Since the file size can exceed 2<sup>32</sup> bytes, and in some
compilation configurations of PuTTY the host platform's largest
integer type is only 32 bits wide, PuTTY extracts the decimal file
size into a temporary string variable to send to its own 64-bit
decimal decoding function. Unfortunately, that extraction was done
carelessly, using a <code>sscanf</code> with no length limit,
permitting a buffer overrun.
